webpackJsonp([23],{"/lw5":function(e,n){e.exports='<section><h2>Weapon Refactor</h2>\n<p>In a pre-version 1 iteration that was never published, the weapons stats were mapped from the <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons#Mass_Effect_3">ME3 weapon stats</a>.\nThen I did a lot of tinkering to add some variety to the weapons, but in doing so, I screwed everything up and made many weapons way to powerful.</p>\n<p>This refactor attempts to bring the weapons back in line to their stats, as well as add any additional effect the weapon had in-game.\nFor example, the <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M-37_Falcon">M-37 Falcon</a> is essentially a grenade launcher, but there was nothing in\nthis system that mirrored that mechanic. Now it has:</p>\n<pre><code>Instead of making a ranged weapon attack, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + DEX modifier). If you are\nproficient with Assault Rifles, add your proficiency bonus to the DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful one.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Damage was also scaled back, but not too much. Originally, the conversion was that all &quot;automatic&quot; weapons had a 5-6 Rate of Fire(RoF), but 5-6 damage die is A LOT.\nShotguns also had a high RoF accounting for the amount of bullets in a single blase, which created ambiguity between fire rate and bullet count.\nThree-round burst weapons has 3, Semi-auto has 2, and there were a few single shot, like sniper rifles. This also created a very large\nspread on the damage tables.</p>\n<p>In the refactor, there is a new weapon type: &quot;Semi-automatic&quot;. By default these only have an RoF of 1, but you can use your bonus\naction to fire another shot. This makes the standard D&amp;D 5e dual wielding mechanic more accessible, i.e., if you\'ve got a\nsemi-automatic weapon, you can make a second attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>Three-round burst weapons have an RoF of 3, and automatic and RoF of 4, with a few minor exceptions for weapons that had\nridiculously higher RoFs in the game like the Tempest SMG and a few Heavy Weapons.</p>\n<p>The end result is more generalized weapons by type that have enough variety in range, heat, and mechanic to make your choice fun:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assault Rifles: Vary more than any other weapon type but are generally automatic with lower heat and a medium range</li>\n<li>Heavy Pistols: Semi-automatic, light, with high heat and medium range</li>\n<li>Shotguns: Short range power houses with low heat but a variety of punch.</li>\n<li>SMGs: Short range, high RoF, low damage.</li>\n<li>Sniper rifles: Long range &amp; high damage with limited RoF and Heat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rare weapons have an increased cost (20k credits). This should make them unattainable to low level players and\ngives them a monetary cost to their awesomeness. Obviously, GMs can adjust cost to their needs.</p>\n<p>And finally, this version includes new melee weapons!</p>\n<p>Melee weapon attributes work exactly like their D&amp;D 5e counterparts (finesse, light, thrown, versatile, reach, etc). Most weapons have a special\nability as well. However, to replace the &quot;proficiency&quot; aspect of melee weapons (since there are so few), there is a STR requirement.\nAnyone can wield a melee weapon, but if you don\'t have the required STR mod (matching or above) your melee attacks with the weapon are\nmade at a disadvantage.</p>\n<h2>New Spells</h2>\n<p>A host of new spells and tech powers have been added. Primarily these were based on 5th edition, adding a bit more variety\nthan simple damage dealing abilities, and adding more options for Vanguards and Sentinels.</p>\n<h2>Spell damage</h2>\n<p>With a few exceptions, damage for all damage dealing biotic spells have been adjusted to fit the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrips: &lt; 10 avg damage</li>\n<li>1st Level: 10-15 avg damage</li>\n<li>2nd level: 15 - 22 avg damage</li>\n<li>3rd level: 20 - 28 avg damage</li>\n<li>4th level: 25-35 avg damage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change was made to add a bit more scaling to the spells, as 4th level spells are effectively 6-7th level D&amp;D spells.</p>\n<h2>Class changes</h2>\n<p>A few class changes, primarily in name. Vanguards received some tweaking. Cabals are a very specific Turian Vanguard,\nso it didn\'t make much sense for them to be a subclass. Thus, Cabals have become Nemesis vanguards, a caster-oriented flavor.</p>\n<h2>New Race</h2>\n<p>Unshackled AI, a slight variant from Geth. Are you a rogue AI or a corporate masterpiece? You can decide with this versatile new race.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>New weapon type: Semi-automatic\nWhen you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you can use your bonus action to make a second ranged attack. You do not add your Dexterity\nmodifier to the attack or damage roll. The second attack may be on the same or a different target.</p>\n<p>Added melee weapons.</p>\n<h3>Feats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New Feat: Hair Trigger, gives you an advantage when using semi-automatic weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<h4>Class Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the &quot;Up close and personal&quot; fighting style.</li>\n<li>Added the &quot;Carnage&quot; fighting style, which specifically buffs shotgun use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Engineer</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed &quot;Kamakaze drone&quot; to &quot;Disruptor drone&quot;, more in line with <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Disruption_Drone">the game</a>.</li>\n<li>Renamed &quot;Support&quot; sublcass to &quot;Medic&quot;, more in line with <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Engineer#Class_Talent">the game</a></li>\n<li>Added some additional subclass features to the Demolisher.

Most notably is his <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/205\">Angara concept</a>.\nWe're not quite ready to include everything in the system because we need to do a bit of housekeeping on the backend. But, we encourage you to test\nout the race and provide feedback!</p>\n<h4>Digital Character Sheet</h4>\n<p>Ben has also been working on a version of the Character Sheet in Google Sheets. Once the finishing touches are ready, we'll get it up on the site.</p>\n<h4>Loot Generator</h4>\n<p>As the dust settles on the cost of mods, weapons, and armor, we've been working on a Loot Generator and guidelines for awarding credits. That should be out in the very near future.</p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a note about race/class restrictions. Though we provide a rule of thumb, final decisions should be made by the GM.</li>\n<li>Created a Combat section in the rules to reduce the length of General rules. (Some rules now exist in multiple locations, if applicable to that category).</li>\n<li>Added infrared vision as a new sense.</li>\n<li>Changed Rapid Reload to a bonus action and made it a variant rule.</li>\n<li>Changed Thermal Clips to a standard rule. Not tracking thermal clips is a variant rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed Perception as skill option for Sentinels &amp; Adepts. Added for Infiltrators &amp; Soldiers.</li>\n<li>Added additional information about spellcasting to each class page.</li>\n<li>Vanguards weapon proficiency choices changed. Instead of automatically gaining shotguns, vanguards automatically gain melee and have the option of shotguns.\nVanguards are geared heavily towards a melee class and should gain that proficiency.</li>\n<li>Sniper fighting style changed to +2(basic) and +4(adv) damage made with Sniper Rifles if no hostile creature is within 10m.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To accommodate the changes in Lift, Biotic Control allows the Adept to lift a target 1 size larger than its current capability.</li>\n<li>Barrier Ticks rescaled from 2-5</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Engineers</h3>\n<p>As alluded to in our previous release, we've been working on an overhaul of the Drone Jockey (Engineer) subclass and it's finally here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Drones are now a stat block in the bestiary. As such, the Drone ability will summon the bestiary version. Medics\nare still the only subclass that can access the Repair (Healing) drone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drone Jockeys are completely refactored. Though the multi-drone approach was fun, it significantly slowed down combat and proved slightly too powerful at all levels.\nInstead, Drone Jockeys function almost identically to 5th Edition's Ranger - Beast Conclave. You'll get to create a Drone Companion that persists outside of combat,\ngains valuable stat and defensive increases, and has its own personality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved Evasion to the 14th level</li>\n<li>Removed Cunning Action at 14th level</li>\n<li>New ability Fast Hands gained at 7th level</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentinels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added barrier ticks (2-6) and the ability to cast Barrier, Barrier Detonation, Lash, Phase Disruptor.</li>\n<li>Sentinels can take the Protection fighting style.</li>\n<li>Increased spell and tech point progression, bringing them in line with Vanguard and Infiltrator casting potency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Soldiers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharpshooter subclass features aligned with 5th Edition's Sharpeshooter class from the <a href=\"https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2016_Fighter_UA_1205_1.pdf\">Unearthed Arcana</a></li>\n<li>Gain Tactical Clip at 7th level for faster reloading</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Vanguards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier ticks rescaled, still from 3-10, but distributed more evenly across levels</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<p>Primarily due to work of the contributors listed above, we audited each race. We focused on missing lore specific traits,\nbalancing the traits between races, and clarifying trait mechanics. Of particular note, Asari will use Charisma as their\nspellcasting modifier for biotic spells, rather than Wisdom.</p>\n<h3>Asari</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrip replaced with Biotic Initiate, similar to 5th Edition's Magic Initiate, giving all Asari some biotic powers</li>\n<li>Asari always use Charisma as their spellcasting modifier for biotic spells.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Geth</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 STR</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Krogan</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Powerful Build</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarian</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 CON.</li>\n<li>Hermetic suit uses exhaustion rules when breached.</li>\n<li>Options for Cybernetic Augmentation improved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Turian</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added radiant resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Volus</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to reflect their race: intuitive with above-average intelligence (+2 wis, +1 int)</li>\n<li>Savvy Dealings, now gives proficiency in Persuasion. The &quot;discounts from vendors&quot; was too open-ended and could pidgeon-hole Volus players making all shop transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vorcha</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added poison resistance &amp; limb regeneration</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unshackled-AI.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed option of starting feat, balancing their lvl 1 options with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Charge</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Necrotic Strike</em> removed. Replaced with Barrier Regen. References classic Charge/Nova Vanguard from ME3. But primarily</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decoy</strong>. Clarified the spell's mechanic</li>\n<li><strong>Guidance</strong>. bonus can be used on attack rolls. Limited to 1 target.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Multi Tap</em>. Allows application og Guidance to 3 targets (must still cast the spell for each target).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Invasion</strong> renamed to AI Hacking. Better elicits the spell mechanic and allows for creation of Andromeda's Invasion in the future.\ngives Vanguards another option to regain barrier ticks.</li>\n<li><strong>Lift</strong>. removed the &quot;Sleep&quot; mechanic and changed to a ranged spell attack. Cannot benefit from being cast at higher levels. Limited to Medium target.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Control</em>, now a bonus action, reduced movement to 6m.</li>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Heavy Lift</em>, allows you to lift a Large object or creature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Overload</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quad Leap</em> removed. Replace with increased damage options.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong>. Sentry turret is now a stat block, casting this spell creates a turret.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactical Scan</strong> duration reduced from Infinite to 10 minutes</li>\n<li><strong>Turbocharge</strong> Removed. With the removal of RoF, Turbocharge was removed. We will add it back in a later version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Geth Forces</li>\n<li>Added Drones</li>\n<li>Centurion: was missing speed, saving throws, and senses. CR was too low. Added resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, which correctly brings CR to 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<h3>Weapon Balance</h3>\n<p>If you averaged the damage of all weapons before and after v0.7.0, you could argue that we've nerfed the weapons. But\nwe consider this version to bring a much better balance to the weapon system, despite the slightly reduced damage overall.</p>\n<p>We noticed quite a few problems with the previous versions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Weapons dealt 15-20% more damage than in 5th Edition</li>\n<li>The spread of damage was huge 1d4 =&gt; 4d10</li>\n<li>The Rate of Fire mechanic didn't have any benefits other than being flavor about the weapon. And even the flavor was difficult to apply.\nTake the M-4 Shuriken: in the game, this weapon specifically has a six-round burst, meaning 6 RoF. But since it's meant to be a starting weapon, we had to make it deal 6d1. There are other cases where RoF didn't directly correlate.</li>\n<li>Weapon damage was unbalanced. We received a lot of feedback that Shotguns were too powerful, Sniper rifles underpowered, and melee weapons worthless.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our solution was to create weapon profiles and build from those profiles. In doing so we also created distinct levels for\nthe weapons that mirror 5th edition's item rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare). This provided a system in which we could\nmake objectively better weapons, whereas previous versions attempted to make all weapons unique (save for the starting weapons).</p>\n<p>We're very pleased with the result and feel the weapons are more balanced than they've ever been. If you'd like to read the entire\ndiscussion, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/249\">github issue</a>. Additionally, we prepared\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSq70x_GZuDKcELgX8k_7Hd6nLGu3DoIEdDwP-YEGjUU-ghGc7ot_Q7140FZwGbEalHgzPwVm4BN8y_/pubhtml?gid=332103674&amp;single=true\">an analysis</a> of the new weapon balance.</p>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Weapons now have a 4-tier rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare.</li>\n<li>Weapon costs have been adjusted to reflect rarities: Common &gt;= 3,000, Uncommon &gt;= 10,000, Rare &gt;= 30,000, Very Rare &gt;= 50,000</li>\n<li>Rate of Fire (RoF) has been removed. While we liked the flavor it added, it didn't have any other benefit. Plus, it was difficult to keep the flavor consistent among weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Assault Rifles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle: 4d6 =&gt; 2d6, deals and additional 1d6 damage to synthetic targets.</li>\n<li>Cerberus Harrier: 4d4 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>Geth Pulse Rifle: 6d4 =&gt; 2d6, deals radiant damage</li>\n<li>M-15 Vindicator: 3d4 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>M-55 Argus: 3d6 =&gt; 1d12</li>\n<li>M-7 Lancer: 4d6 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>M-76 Revenant: 5d4 =&gt; 3d4</li>\n<li>M-8 Avenger: 3d4 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>M-96 Mattock: 1d10 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>M-99 Saber: 1d10 =&gt; 3d6, customization options changes</li>\n<li>N7 Typhoon: 5d4 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>N7 Valkyrie: 2d6 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>Particle Rifle: 6d4 =&gt; 2d10</li>\n<li>Phaeston: 4d4 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Striker Assault Rifle: 4d6 =&gt; 1d12, special updated, can start targeting to deal additional damage</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Heavy Pistols</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Acolyte: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n<li>Arc Pistol: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n<li>Executioner Pistol: 1d12 =&gt; 2d12</li>\n<li>M-358 Talon: 2d8 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>N7 Eagle: 4d4 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Scorpion: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Melee</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Asari Huntress Sword: 1d6 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>Krogan Warhammer: 1d12 =&gt; 2d6 (1d12 as a one-handed weapon)</li>\n<li>Monomolecular blade: 1d8 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>Omni-blade: 1d6 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>Omni-hammer: 1d8 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>Omni-whip: 1d8 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shotguns</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AT-12 Raider: 2d10 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>Disciple: 2d6 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Geth Plasma Shotgun: 2d12 =&gt; 2d10</li>\n<li>Graal Spike Thrower: 2d12 =&gt; 2d6.

Essentially the heavier, higher heat version of the M-98 Widow</li>\n<li>Javelin: Ignores half AND three-quarters cover (more in line with fiction, as it's the highest piercing weapon)</li>\n<li>Kishock Harpoon Gun: 1d12 =&gt; 3d6.

Removed +2 on ranged attack rolls, added &quot;Can reload as a bonus action&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapon Mods</h3>\n<p>In the last release, we introduced weapon mods, but this was rushed and not thoroughly tested. It became clear that the stacking of certain mods\n(especially between weapons an armor) created very high bonuses. In 5th edition, +X items are limited to +4 for legendary type items, but our\nmod combinations could result in as much as +7. In response, we've changed or removed any armor mods or sets that increased the effectiveness of\nranged weapons. Basically, let weapon mods buff weapons and let armor mods buff defenses. The only caveat is that armor can still provide boosts\nto melee weapons, as they currently have no mods.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename &quot;core&quot; type to &quot;ammo&quot;</li>\n<li>Cranial Trauma Mod: Limit to one level (1 additional damage die on critical hit)</li>\n<li>Power magnifier: Limit to one level (currently lvl 3 has potential to add +9 with some subclasses).</li>\n<li>Concentration Mod: Limit to one level (19-20 crit)</li>\n<li>Piercing Mod: Rename piercing ammo. Negates resistance to piercing damage.</li>\n<li>Shredder mod: Renamed shredder ammo. Changes damage to slashing. Negates resistance to slashing damage.</li>\n<li>Quick release magazine: Limit to 1 level. &quot;You may reload as a bonus action&quot;</li>\n<li>Magazine upgrade: Limit to 1 level. Weapon gains a bonus to heat equal to 1/2 it's base heat score. (useless for 1 heat weapons)</li>\n<li>Extended Magazine: New. Weapon gains a bonus to heat equal to twice it's base heat score (limited for 1 heat weapons)</li>\n<li>High-Velocity Barrel: New. Reroll damage</li>\n<li>Heat sink: removed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Grenades</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased the radius of the smoke grenade to 4m.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Armor</h2>\n<p>Overall, we reduced or removed armor mods/sets/mechanics that increased ranged weapon attack and damage potential to avoid too much\noverlap and stacking between armor and weapon mods.</p>\n<h3>Armor Sets</h3>\n<p>In general, armor set costs were realigned to be 15% less than if you had crafted the armor from scratch, since armor sets cannot be upgrade later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Serrice Adaptor Gauntlets =&gt; cannot select bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing resistance</li>\n<li>Mantis Armor =&gt; +1 AC. Increase your speed by 4m. Increase your grenade capacity by 2.</li>\n<li>Collector Armor =&gt; reworked: +3 AC, auto-stabalize and medi-gel</li>\n<li>N7 Defender Armor =&gt; reworked: 20 shields (regen 10). +2 AC. Increase thermal clip capacity by 4. Increase grenade capacity by 2</li>\n<li>Terminus Assault Armor =&gt; 10 shields (regen 5). Speed +4m.

But this conversion seems to be generating interest,\nand that ain't nothing. Thus, I've got a renewed motivation (urgency?) to get some major work done in the next few months.\nAnd thanks to everyone who has taken a gander.</p>\n<p>But first...</p>\n<h1>Playtesting</h1>\n<p>We had 3 players with the following loadouts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drell Marksman Soldier</li>\n<li>Asari Justicar Adept</li>\n<li>Human Saboteur Infiltrator</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We ran a fast-paced session, testing the classes out on creatures,\nmobs I pulled straight from D&amp;D, bosses (a Banshee), and 2 fully spec'ed NPCs (Sentinel &amp; Engineer).\nWe leveled quickly so we could check out the classes at different phases. Specifically, level 5, 9 and 12.\nOverall, the flow, battle mechanics, spells, etc. all had the necessary feel of both ME and D&amp;D. I was excited to see\nthat they melded together nicely. I even started on a bestiary, creating monsters for various Reaper mobs, including\nMarauders, Cannibals, Husks, and a Banshee. If you're so inclined, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=19iMxTqyu7Vtyqy3I2-INWwurnXea_YuKzy7HbMZMuXw\">check out my prep notes</a>\nfor the very short campaign. <strong>Note</strong>: we didn't get to Operation Driftwood, and we chose Operation Metal Detector.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>I've been quietly working on a key aspect of any game system: <strong>balance</strong>. For the past months, I broken ye 'ole spreadsheets,\nworking on class analysis and overhauling the classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: Some classes vastly outperformed others.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: Classes peaked around level 9, with nominal damage increase beyond level 12.</p>\n<p>I found a D&amp;D class analysis in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIrEV1RFv6yxWEdqG6zP3z-ZONDTacquGyqYj8G-CdE\">The Optimists' Guide to D&amp;D 5E Damage by Class, Subclass, Weapon, and Level</a>.\nIt gave me a framework to review the ME classes. In doing the work, I also tried to align the classes more closely with\nD&amp;D counterparts. Soldiers became more like Fighters, Adepts like Wizards, Sentinels like Paladins. Other minor updates include\na better variety of weapons stats and improving/standardizing spell text.</p>\n<p>All in all, the next iteration will <em>look</em> similar but be a huge overhaul. Rest assured, I'll be sure to make the current\nversion available on the site, in case anyone is running a campaign.</p>\n<h2>Other things in the works</h2>\n<p>General site fixes, a bestiary, armor, adding new spells, printable spell cards, and adding some sort of &quot;NPC maker&quot;.</p>\n<p>This endeavor is far from over...</p>\n<h2>Shoutout</h2>\n<p>Major thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/SleightxHope\">SleightxHope</a> for jumping into Github and contributing a ton of ideas.\nBackgrounds, skills, armor, weapon mods, class rewrites! Can't say thanks enough for the collaboration and playtesting!</p>\n<h2>Where did the old one go?</h2>\n<p>For anyone that wants the old version, click on the\nversion number in the upper-right of the main nav and\nselect &quot;<a href=\"%7Bsite.github.url%7D/v1/\">v0.1.0-alpha</a>&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Why so much change?</h2>\n<p>One major issue was that almost all classes peaked around lvl 9. I started using\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyqV8mnMFzRexQ_pEMnX1-BFRqFt3Jb_uCBjjY3nUdPCMbNT0dXc7Nkd4tIlZlzjv4NuR6xB44Euqd/pubhtml\">spreadsheets</a>\nto track damage progression throughout levels. FYI - Those sheets are sorely\nout of date, as I threw in a plethora of changes last minute. But that's the documentation\nfor how the new classes stack up damage wise. It's really just proof that\nI put in <em>some</em> amount of time trying to balance this system out.</p>\n<p>The other major issue is that I wanted this conversion to reflect D&amp;D 5th Edition\nas much as it could. I'd spent too much time coming up with random abilities and class features\nrather than leaning back on the amazing work WoC does. So, in this iteration, I focused\non taking subclass features from 5e and sticking them in at appropriate levels. There is\nstill plenty of homebrew content, but the classes should have a much more familiar feel than before.</p>\n<h2>Player's Handbook</h2>\n<p>To keep things more sustainable, I've completely rewritten the [player's handbook]({{ site.github.url }}/phb/) into a single page webapp. This\npart of the site will now exist to keep people updated on news, play testing, and other miscellaneous items, like printable character sheets\nand spell cards.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you see any spelling errors or come across any bugs, please <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues\">add an issue in the repo</a></p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<h3>Rules</h3>\n<p>Mostly clarifications with a few minor updates.</p>\n<h4>Weapons</h4>\n<p><strong>Weapon Handling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reloading takes an action</li>\n<li>Holstering and drawing a new weapon is a bonus action</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weapon Stats</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Made the <strong>Rof &amp; Heat</strong> stat simpler. Instead of subtracting RoF from Heat, heat is now the number of times you\ncan fire the weapon before you need to reload.</li>\n<li><strong>Rare</strong> Weapons. Basically a way of saying lvl 1 PCs shouldn't have access to these weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weapon Attributes</strong>\nWeapons now have different types of attributes like &quot;Arc&quot; and &quot;Hip Fire&quot; which give the weapon additional combat perks.</p>\n<p><strong>Removed Hip Fire</strong>\nThe previous version gave all weapons advantage in melee range. Now only Hip Fire weapons have advantage in melee range.\nThe standard D&amp;D rule applies that all other ranged weapons have disadvantage in melee range.</p>\n<h4>Armor</h4>\n<p>Expanded the Armor section. Currently working on pre-made armor sets and armor mods.</p>\n<h4>Consumables</h4>\n<p>It never felt &quot;right&quot; that grenades and ammo powers were &quot;spells&quot;. So I've made them consumables. Consumables\nare kind of like magic items. They have an associated rarity (how often you'll get access to them) and are gone\nonce you use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Medi-gel</strong>\n...has been added. Lets you use a hit die in combat. See Rules &gt; Consumables in the PHB.</p>\n<h4>Skills</h4>\n<p>New Skills: <strong>Engineering</strong>, <strong>Xenology</strong></p>\n<h3>Races</h3>\n<p><strong>Geth</strong>\nI took away a few of the Tech powers that came from geth classes in ME3 Multiplayer mode and made them geth only.\nRepair Matrix and Hunter Mode didn't really make sense for organic creatures. In addition, geth get some really nice\nclass-specific features at level 11. This is to make up for the fact that geth cannot take any feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Quarians</strong>\nRemoved Improvised Grenade and added Cybernetic Augmentation. Read about the latter in the codex and felt the Imp grenade was\nlame.</p>\n<p><strong>Salarains</strong>\nMade Photographic Memory much more powerful, cosidering this is one of the weakest races. Great for Skill Monkeys though!</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>To be honest, so much has changed with the classes, the best I can do is give you an overview of each one. I'm also providing\na % done. By this, I mean how much the class <strong>feels</strong> complete, which should also be an indication of how much it's likely to change\nin the future.</p>\n<h4>General</h4>\n<p><strong>Damage!</strong></p>\n<p>A major issue in the previous iteration was that every class's damage output stopped scaling around level 10. This\nhas been fixed. It also meant implementing a new Max TP system for Engineers, Infiltrators, and Sentinels. Basically, as you\nlevel, you can spend more TP on your Tech Powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Powers</strong></p>\n<p>I added in Combat Powers, which are mechanically like class features (generally only use them once per short/long rest),\nbut give you the customizing feel of spells and tech powers, i.e., you can choose which ones you want. Soldiers choose\nCombat powers as they progress, but Infiltrators can take a few as well instead of learning a tech power. I hope to expand\nthe crossover list further.</p>\n<h4>Adepts</h4>\n<p><strong>90%</strong>\nBrought adepts much more in line with Wizards, borrowing a lot of class and subclass features from D&amp;D.</p>\n<h4>Engineers</h4>\n<p><strong>90%</strong>\nPrimarily worked on the Support subclass, giving it more variety.</p>\n<h4>Infiltrators</h4>\n<p><strong>75%</strong>\nRedistributed and added more of the Rogue features from D&amp;D. Still feels like it could use a little bit more work.</p>\n<h4>Sentinels</h4>\n<p><strong>60%</strong>\nI feel like tech armor changes every time I sit down to do edits. I need to do a lot more playtesting with Sentinels and\nall subclasses before I can put a button in it.</p>\n<h4>Soldiers</h4>\n<p><strong>85%</strong>\nProbably the most drastic overhaul, getting rid of adrenaline dice, reworking the subclasses, adding combat powers,\nand making them progress more like fighters. I'm mostly happy with the outcome.</p>\n<h4>Vanguards</h4>\n<p><strong>75%</strong>\nUpdated subclasses and tried to make them more melee heavy. A mix of Paladins, Barbarians, and Fighters. Could still use\nsome work.</p>\n<h3>Feats</h3>\n<p>Added a new Feat: Grenadier. Hoping to add a few more in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>SleightxHope provided all of these. Will try to add more soon.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>Also major overhauls.</p>\n<p>Well, I think that's everything. This has been a hell of sprint to get all the edits in, but I think it's at a much more stable\nplace where we can slow add new feature and adjust classes. Thanks to anyone out there who is playing!</p>\n</section>\n"},A8CC:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><p>Some minor rule changes and clean-up based on a play test 1/13/18</p>\n<h2>Armor</h2>\n<p>The starting armor was very over powered, so 'standard' armor has been added for level 1 characters.

Improved drones @ 10th level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrator:</h3>\n<p>Sneak attack doesn't need advantage if target is flanked.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier is an Action, with bonus action as available advancement. It was too easy to use all your Barrier Ticks for an attack,\nthen cast it as a bonus action at the end of your turn for defense. While we like this possibility, it shouldn't be available right\noff the bat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Grunt Generator</h2>\n<p>For the past month, I've been quietly working on the bestiary. For people who've read the DMG or used it to create monsters,\nyou'll know it can be a complicated process. That's not a complaint. I love the details and thoroughness provided by WoC.\nBut it means that creating really good monsters takes time.</p>\n<p>My initial tentative list included a lot of archetypes. Not simply an archetype for each class, but archetypes that could span Challenge Rating (CR),\nraces, classes, etc. But while working on the archetypes, I was repeating a ton of work. The silver lining was that I\nrealized many of these archetypes could be 1) programmatically created and 2) randomized.</p>\n<p>This led me to designing a utility that could generate archetypes with random stats, features, and actions. I call it\nthe &quot;Grunt Generator.&quot; No, this isn't a <em>Home Improvement</em> reference. A &quot;grunt&quot; is a throwaway NPC. It's not as specific\nor unique as a monster, but it doesn't have the time and effort of a reoccurring or important NPC (like a boss or rival team).\nUsing the monster creation logic in the DMG, I created a very complex, programmatic &quot;flowchart.&quot; It adjusts\nattack bonus, defensive bonuses, and damage per round based on the chosen CR level. This ensures that the generated grunts aren't too powerful or too weak.</p>\n<p>Another benefit this utility brings is variety. With Wizard's Monster Manual, Volo's Guide, and the plethora of other books in existence,\nthere are hundreds if not thousands of monsters to choose from. I could spend years working on Mass Effect monsters and not come close\nto the amount provided in D&amp;D. So I took a short cut. The randomized stats, class, race, features, spells, tech\nand weapons means the number of unique grunts totals in the tens of thousands!</p>\n<p>Finally, a hidden benefit I hadn't planned for was loot. Because the weapons that a grunt has equipped are\nrandomized, when players take out a grunt, they can loot the body. This makes it really easy to pass out new weapon options\nto your players. Armor isn't a part of the grunt generator (yet?), so you'll still need to decided if there is any armor to\nloot. But at least the weapons are easy!</p>\n<p>In the Player's Handbook, you'll find a new section, &quot;GM Tools&quot;. In the future, I hope to fill this with other utilities,\nbut for now you can use the Grunt Generator. Pick you target CR, class, and race get generating! You can save the generated\ngrunt and make a list for your encounters. I'm eventually going to turn the list into a true encounter\nutility, which will let you pull in monsters from the bestiary. I've also got plans to improve the Grunt Generator,\nlike advanced options to let you tailor you grunts a bit more.</p>\n<p>Please note, I'm still working on the bestiary. Hopefully this new feature will keep your campaigns active and fun until\nI can get an official bestiary up. And don't be afraid to use monsters available in D&amp;D, this is a large universe!</p>\n</section>\n"},B7Hl:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><p>Version 0.1.0-alpha means this bad boy is just getting started. But it's at a point where I'm ready for the first\nplaytest (scheduled for June 2). Anyone who stumbles upon this site should feel free to play test as well and use whatever\nto start a campaign, but note that things will be a-changin' a lot.</p>\n<p>But in a month, we've come a long way. All the spells, classes, and races are spec'ed out. Though multiple play tests we'll\nneed to work on balancing the system. There's also a lot of unknowns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will the shield mechanic be a pain in the ass to track?</li>\n<li>What about the weapons? Are they too overpowered? Underpowered compared to abilities?</li>\n<li>Should classes be able to cast more or less?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Already I know that some classes feel less desirable and interesting than others. I worked on the Vanguard and Sentinel last\nso they benefited from a month of learning and refactoring. All the Adept classes seem a little underwhelming, but this might\nbe balanced by their ability to take and cast the most spells.</p>\n<p>But at this point, any changes would be entirely guesswork. So...ONWARD! TO PLAY TESTING!</p>\n</section>\n"},"E+BQ":function(e,n){e.exports="<section><h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reloading updated. Players may attempt to reload as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>Primer and Detonator rules added as variant rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thermal Clips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New thermal clips added: Drill, Explosive, Phasic</li>\n<li>Thermal clip mechanics changed to account for addition of primer and detonators.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Armor Mods &amp; Sets</h3>\n<p>Armor or mods that granted an increase in shield regen die type, now increase shield regen by 5.\nArmor sets that had +shield points, have the total shields and regen amount listed.</p>\n<h3>Shields</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shields\n<ul>\n<li>Flat temporary HP that no longer increase with level</li>\n<li>Gained from armor and items, not inherent to the player character</li>\n<li>Regenerate fully on a short/long rest</li>\n<li>Regenerate in combat if the player takes the Dodge or Hide action then takes no damage until the start of the player's next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Something that's been nagging me for some time is the shield mechanic. The idea was this: shields make up half of a\nplayer's health and slowly regenerate if they don't take damage. Sounds great, right? But a simple, great sounding idea\ncan get complicated quickly. The first major hurdle was divvying up player health. Trying to 'split dice' resulted in\na total health pool about 10% higher than in 5th edition. When I factored in the average rate of shield\nregen the increase jumped to more than 25% higher.</p>\n<p>More importantly, rolling each turn to get shields back wasn't very exciting and took up a lot of time. Each round of\ncombat, players had to think: <em>did I take damage? I didn't...</em> [rolls dice] <em>...oh, goody, 2 sp I need track</em>. I found\nthat players actively choose <em>not</em> to roll because they didn't really care for the benefit.</p>\n<p>The final problem was the mechanic didn't fit the fiction. What happens when a player removes their armor? Do they still have shields?\nWhat is the underlying effect that causes you to gain more shields when you level up?</p>\n<p>Through discussions with Swampson, we cam up with an alternative that we believe fixes all of these problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shields no longer level up with the character.</li>\n<li>Shields are a small regenerating pool of temporary hp.</li>\n<li>Shields come standard in all chest armor pieces, with a base of 5 shield points and a regen of 5. Both can be increased with mods.</li>\n<li>Shields only recharge an amount equal to their regen when the character takes the Hide or Dodge action and then takes no damage until the start of their next turn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#1 &amp; #2 fix the health and fiction issues. But I'm especially excited about #3. The idea of hiding or dodging to recharge\nyour shields is a great reflection of Mass Effect combat. Plus, the reward has more potential for the player. Although, 5 additional\nhit points doesn't sound like a lot, it is for a level 1 character wearing standard armor, and as players level up they can\nget upwards of 30-40 shield points via upgrading their armor. What I really enjoy is that players now have an\nactive choice in regaining shields, but there is still some luck involved.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, I'm also a fan of how well this mechanic blends with the existing 5th edition rules. Instead of a more\ncomplex set of hp, shields are akin to a cantrip that provides temporary hp. The increase in health isn't too much to break\nthe system, but enough to help mitigate the lack of healing spells.</p>\n<p>If you've got any thoughts on this change, feel free to use the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1\">feedback form</a>.</p>\n<h2>Spells &amp; Powers</h2>\n<p>Any spell effect that had a player 'gain shield points', now only effects players wearing armor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annihilation Field: <strong>Drain</strong> option replaced with <strong>Phasic</strong>, which bypasses shields.</li>\n<li>Shocking touch: <strong>Absorbing Shock</strong> option replaced with <strong>Reach</strong>, increasing the range of the power.</li>\n<li>Siege Pulse: Shield point cost reduced to 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<h3>Geth</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunter Mode: No longer reduces shields.

My goal is 100 unique monsters and npcs by the end\nof April (no promises!). For now, I am happy to be able to give you the Reaper and Collector forces. Before you get too excited,\nno, this does not include a Reaper. That's a task that will take extensive play testing. But, with the random grunt generator,\nI hope this is enough to get you started on a fun campaign. From here on out, instead of a huge drop in April, I'll add\nfactions as I complete them. Cerberus is next, followed by the Geth, then the mercenary factions (Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack).\nFinishing out the bestiary with some aliens, re-skined 5th edition monsters that I think fit well into the universe, and some\nnamed NPCS.

We're not 100% on the layout and style, but when we are, we'll release a\nprinting guide to go along with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rule dialogs added for quick reference.</li>\n<li>Tooltips added for conditions</li>\n<li>Special thermal clips added as possible npc feature in the grunt generator.</li>\n<li>Spell cards added to printables section</li>\n<li>Bookmarks allow you to save spells, weapons, and npcs for quick reference</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n"},FClN:function(e,n){e.exports='<section><p>In early 2017, I began listening to <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">The Adventure Zone</a>\nand became intrigued by D&amp;D 5th edition. \x3c!--more--\x3e Quick, tangential shout-out: if I threw in all my favorite books, music, movies,\netc into sorted list, TAZ would rank in the top 10. Seriously, you should be listening to it.</p>\n<p>You\'re probably wondering, &quot;How is it 2017 and you\'ve not played 5th Edition?&quot;. Well I\'m not a very experience TRPG\'er.\nUp to this point I\'d only gamed within Pinnacle\'s <a href="https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/">Savage Worlds</a> system.\nSo after a few episodes of TAZ, I got myself a 5e player\'s handbook and read that mofo cover to cover. What I enjoyed\nmost was the de-emphasis of strategic tabletop battling and the emphasis of creative problem-solving. Plus the simplicity\nof the die rolling was appealing:</p>\n<p><code>D20 + modifying_numbers &gt; target_number ? success : failure</code></p>\n<p>Though the game certainly gets more complicated, the base equation is simple enough for inexperienced players to wrap\ntheir heads around.</p>\n<p>Now, I enjoy a fantasy setting as much as the next nerd, but I\'d pick sci-fi over fantasy nine times out of ten. And what\'s\njust came out? That\'s right...<a href="https://www.masseffect.com/">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>. Mass Effect is one of my favorite sci-fi\nuniverses but it\'s got another key feature: the wizard, i.e., spellcasting. Plus, you have an entire <em>universe</em> to run a\ncampaign. You can focus on space exploration, fighting Reapers, policing the Milky Way, or mixing with the Citadel politics.</p>\n<p>So I got this crazy idea, <em>I want to play a TRPG Mass Effect</em>.\nMy current DM said, &quot;I think there are a few out there already.&quot; And, yeah, I found a few in various states of completion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Works\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://masseffectd6.blogspot.com/">Mass Effect D6</a>, a Star Wars D6 conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150629183534/http://masseffectrpg.org/wp/?page_id=51">Mass Effect Fate RPG</a>, a FATE conversion</li>\n<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5c7osZJmQnvQ09YVHFNaXdSLVk/edit">Mass Effect d20 system</a>, a OGL d20 conversion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Mass:_the_Effecting">Mass: the Effecting</a>, a nWoD conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.pegforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=35981">Mass Effect: Ascension</a>, a Savage Worlds conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://rpgcrank.blogspot.com/p/savage-worlds-mass-effect.html">Savage Worlds: Mass Effect</a>, Savage Worlds again.</li>\n<li><a href="https://destination-zero.obsidianportal.com/wikis/mass-effect-conversion-rules">A Mass Effect Game for Traveller</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even found the beginnings of a <a href="https://edster504.wordpress.com">5e conversion</a>.

I'm deputizing him at the official &quot;Copy Editor&quot; of this project, whether he likes it or not.</p>\n<h3>Encumbrance &amp; Carry Capacity</h3>\n<p>Bringing this rule in line with 5th Edition. Lifting and Carrying rules added. Includes a limit on number of weapons you may carry\nand armor matrix has minimum strength scores. In addition, an Encumbrance Variant rule is added that uses weapon &amp; armor weight.</p>\n<h2>Armor Sets</h2>\n<p>A big addition in 0.4.0 is the pre-made Armor Sets. They're cheaper than creating custom armor, but lack the ability to be customized.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mod Overhaul</h2>\n<p>I've finally rounded out and standardized the the available armor mods. In addition, there are also detailed instructions\nfor creating armor mods in the armor rules section. So feel free to create your own!</p>\n<h2>Feedback form</h2>\n<p>And finally, I've added a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1\">Google Form</a> so anyone can provide feedback without having to make a Github account.</p>\n<h2>Starting equipment</h2>\n<p>Due to the addition to the armor sets, each race also has a starting weapon and armor. Each race has the option of rolling for credits to buy their own equipment.\nEvery die count/die type combination averages to about 25,000 credits. But based on lifespan, you may get roll more or less die.\nThe reasoning is that long-lived (asari, krogan) races have a higher chance to be average in their monetary gains . Whereas, short-lived\nraces (salarians, vorcha) have a higher probability of either being in their peak or low of their monetary gains. Since it's just\na starting roll, it shouldn't effect gameplay too much. It was a nice way to factor in that flavor. The only exceptions are Volus, who only start with money\nand Geth/Unshackled AI, who effectively don't need to purchase armor, so start with less.</p>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Semi-Automatic&quot; renamed to &quot;Double Tap&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<p>Updates saving throws:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adept: CON &amp; CHA =&gt; WIS &amp; CHA</li>\n<li>Sentinel: WIS &amp; CHA =&gt; CON &amp; CHA</li>\n<li>Vanguard: CON &amp; STR =&gt; WIS &amp; STR</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Engineers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Demolisher's Advanced Weapon Holsters reworded to account for new weight/encumbrance rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<h3>Geth &amp; Unshackled AI</h3>\n<p>Composite plating updated, now AC is 13 + DEX modifier.</p>\n<h3>Quarians</h3>\n<p>Cybernetic Augmentation reworded to account for new weight/encumbrance rules</p>\n<h3>Salarians</h3>\n<p>Added amphibious trait\nPhotographic memory changed.

There aren't any new monsters,\na planned Drone Jockey overhaul was left to the wayside, and some spell changes didn't make it in. The reason is that\nI've spent the majority of my time working on a major overhaul of the back-end of the site.</p>\n<p>Prior to this release there were some major hurdles I was battling with. For one, the Player's Handbook (PHB) and the information pages (index, about, news), were split\nbetween 2 systems (Vue and Jekyll). I'd also been 'hacking' my development setup which often caused errors which led to hours debugging.\nAdditionally, the setup had a fatal flaw in that permalinked urls to the player's handbook would render blank pages, which\nmeant site crawlers weren't able to parse any information in the PHB pages. I'm not too concerned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO), but felt that\ncrawlers should at least be able to scan the bulk of the content.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted a bit more pizazz and clarification on the homepage to explain what this system was and how to get started. My\nanalytics were showing a pretty high bounce rate (lower is better) on the homepage, but a high acquisition rate for users that\nmanaged to make it to the Player's Handbook. I.e., users would land on the site, see only news and the logo and think, &quot;We'll this looks\npretty lame, bye!&quot;</p>\n<p>What was initially a piecemeal approach to fixing these issues turned into a complete overhaul, which took much longer than I originally anticipated.</p>\n<h2>The Good News</h2>\n<h4>1. Fancy new site pages</h4>\n<p>I probably enjoy this more than most. But the homepage, about section, and news section all have new styles.</p>\n<h4>2. Increased interest in the system</h4>\n<p>Over the past 2 weeks, I've received a swarm of feedback. At least 7 people have mentioned they're getting ready to start a campaign.\nThis has me floored. Before, I knew of only a few groups who were actively using the system. Not it seems like we're up to about a dozen.\nThe more users we have the more feedback and play testing we'll get, which will really help the system evolve.</p>\n<p>On this note, I need to give some shoutouts to Ben McPherson, Noel Moriarty, Adam (TheMarmotKing), and Alex Needleman who've been working really hard on pointing out\nsite bugs, over/underpowered mechanics, and creating new content. Keep up the good work everyone!</p>\n<h4>3. Still get some new changes</h4>\n<p>Even though my time was limited, I was still able to push a host of new changes, but this is mainly thanks to the aforementioned people.</p>\n<p>The major addition is that Weapon Mods were added. These will give players a new way to get bonuses on weapons which helps alleviate the lack of\n+N magical items that 5th edition has. Another big change was the increase opportunities for classes to learn Tech and Biotic powers, which should\nhelp make the classes feel less stale between levels.</p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed &quot;Backgrounds&quot; page. Information was incomplete and not applicable. Will be re-introduced when backgrounds are complete.</li>\n<li>Added basic information about resupply costs for items (Medi-gel, Heavy weapon charges, thermal clips, and grenades).</li>\n<li>The opportunity to quickly reload a weapon has been labeled &quot;Rapid Reload,&quot; and is performed as a reaction to taking the Reload action.\nHowever, the Rapid Reload reaction cannot be taken by a player wielding 2 weapons.</li>\n<li>Added Infrared Vision as a ersatz replacement for Truesight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<p>Starting weapon choices adjusted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M-8 Avenger replaces M-96 Mattock</li>\n<li>M-4 Shuriken replaces M-25 Hornet</li>\n<li>M-92 Mantis replaces M-13 Raptor</li>\n<li>Fighting Style: amended to allow classes that learn this ability twice (soldiers, sentinels, &amp; vanguards) to learn 2 initial perks from two different fighting styles or\none initial and one advanced perk from a single fighting style.</li>\n<li>Brawler Fighting style updated. Proficiency bonus added to melee attack damage rolls. Advantage on melee attacks moved to advanced perk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adepts learn 2 cantrips and 2 1st level spells at level 1. This makes up for the fact that Adepts do not gain any basic ability at level 1.\nI.e., Engineers = Drone; Infiltrators = Tactical Cloak, Sentinel = Tech Armor, etc.</li>\n<li>Additional opportunities to learn biotic spells. Total opportunities = 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Engineers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineer's Efficiency added at level 3, providing the engineer with a cantrip-like tech power.</li>\n<li>Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers. Total opportunities = 14</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tech power acquisition redistributed, allowing 9 opportunities to learn or advance tech powers (used to be 6).</li>\n<li>Tech point maximum increased to end at max 8, instead of max 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentinels</h3>\n<p>Overall, Sentinels were reworked to provide more opportunities to <strong>learn</strong> biotic spells and tech powers, but they can never\ncast those spells with the potency of Engineers or Adepts. This change also balances potential multi-classing. I.e., a multi-classed\nAdept/Engineer could have 8 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 10 Biotic spells (max spell slot 3rd level). Whereas a max level Sentinel\ncould have 7 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 8 Biotic Spells (max spell slot 3rd level).</p>\n<h3>Vanguards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the automatic acquisition of Barrier at level 1. Instead, Vanguards can choose one of the following cantrips: Charge, Biotic Punch, Barrier, or Throw</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed Sentinel Mastery class feature, replaced with additional opportunity to learn a biotic spell and tech power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increased the level at which Sentinels can learn biotic spells: 5th level = 1st level spells, 9th level = 2nd level spells, 15th level = 3rd level spells.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers and biotic spells. Total opportunities = 15</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Krogans</em> can be Engineers, this is in line with the Andromeda lore, and there is nothing relevant in the codex that would justify them\nnot being able to be Engineers.</li>\n<li><em>Salarians</em>: added High Metabolism trait indicating they need a limited amount of sleep.</li>\n<li>Removed confusing syntax about taking a feat. Before, site stated that Ability Score Improvements could be substituted for a feat &quot;available to your race&quot;.\nFeat acquisition is only limited during character creation for level 1 characters. Otherwise, all feats are available to all races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added normal and long range distance to ranged weapons. Essentially, this added a limit to which weapons cannot be fired beyond.</li>\n<li>Melee weapon attack damage bypasses shields.</li>\n<li>Krogan Warhammer no longer stuns or pushes enemy back. Instead, has the possibility to knock the target prone.</li>\n<li>M-8 Avenger: RoF reduced to 3</li>\n<li>M-96 Mattock: Damage increased to d10</li>\n<li>M-4 Shuriken: Damage reduced to d1</li>\n<li>M-25 Hornet: Range increased to 8m</li>\n<li>M-13 Raptor: Damage increased to d8</li>\n<li>All Heavy Weapons are unique (cannot be modded)</li>\n<li>Double Tap allows Dex mod to be used when making the attack roll (not damage roll). Used to prevent dex mod from being applied to attack and damage roll. This bring the skill in line\nwith 5th Edition's Two-Weapon Fighting rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Armor</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase potency cost of <code>+1 to melee, ranged, biotic, tech, or combat</code> attack and damage rolls from 8000/level to 12000/level. Bring this in line\nwith weapon mods cost.</li>\n<li>Potency should never be &lt; 3</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New cantrips: Biotic Push &amp; Biotic Punch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Site improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated homepage, about page, news page, changelog</li>\n<li>Spell sorting/filtering added</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where Race page footer navigation had &quot;Next class&quot; as the button label</li>\n<li>Fixes bug where Biotic Walls advancement, Shifting Wall, did not display complete description.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n"},jBiX:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><h2>General</h2>\n<h3>AC</h3>\n<p>The way AC is calculated has been changed.

We're working on a larger starship rule set, which we'll release in v0.9.0.</p>\n<p>Omni-gel is a new resource that is necessary to power tool kit abilities.</p>\n<p>As this is brand new content, we would love to hear your <a href=\"/contributing\">feedback and ideas</a>.</p>\n<h3>Burst Fire</h3>\n<p>We've introduced a new weapon feature that borrows from the Dungeon Master's Guide, <em>Burst Fire</em>. Weapons with Burst Fire allow players to spend their action\n&quot;spraying and praying&quot; giving a bit more variety to assault rifles and smgs.</p>\n<h3>Fighting styles</h3>\n<p>The advanced versions of fighting styles have been removed. Trying to balance advanced fighting styles proved difficult,\nand many advanced versions we're too powerful. In addition, some fighting styles have been updated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gunslinger: Effectively grants Two-Weapon fighting for ranged weapons. Though it can no longer stack with Double Tap, there is no damage penalty on the attack\nmade with your bonus action.</li>\n<li>The Freehand: Description clarified to provide bonus when wielding a weapon that is not two-handed</li>\n<li>Carnage: Replaced with damage reroll (similar to 5th Edition's Great Weapon Fighter).</li>\n<li><em>(New)</em> Close Quarters Shooter: Slightly less powerful version of 5th editions, the limitations are put in place because the majority of combat is ranged and the\nbenefit of the 5th edition version out-shined all other offensive fighting styles</li>\n<li><em>(New)</em> Assault: Increases your Burst Fire capability</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Barrier</h3>\n<p>Barrier has proved to be a difficult ability to figure out. One of the primary problems is that barrier has changed between\nevery game. Here are the iterations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mass Effect 1: Active boost in shields points, specifically providing an additional layer of shields for a duration</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 2: Active boost to overall damage reduction</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 3:Vanguards and Adepts had a 'biotic barrier' instead of shields which powered some biotic abilities.\nThere was also a power called Barrier that worked like ME2, but had a new barrier detonation component.</li>\n<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda: Passive bonuses to shields</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the onset of the project, we've wanted to keep unique and iconic powers, one of which was the Nova Vanguard which\ngrew in popularity in Mass Effect 3. So we created a system that could improve spells by using a resource <em>other than</em> spell slots.\nBut this has added a dimension of spell complexity not found in 5th edition. The other problem was barrier ticks, a class\nresource that could only be regenerated with a cantrip. This ultimated made the cantrip mandatory. Therefore, we've made Barrier\na class feature available to Adepts, Sentinels, and Vanguards.</p>\n<p>Here is the breakdown of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em>Nerfs</em>&quot;\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling damage reduction removed, instead classes gain increased damage reduction at specific levels.</li>\n<li>Barrier has a limited number of casts based on your class level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>&quot;<em>Buffs</em>&quot;\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier can be cast as an action or bonus action</li>\n<li>Having an active barrier does not reduce speed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope that this makes barrier less confusing without completely overhauling the system.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Instead of learning cantrips as part of your spell gains, you instead learn cantrips as you progress in your class level.\nIn short, you know a number of cantrips (advanced count as 2 cantrips) based on the number of cantrips known on your progression table.</p>\n<h3>Detonators</h3>\n<p>The potency of detonators have been increased slightly, giving them a more satisfying feel. We will continue to work on how to make these more attractive.</p>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<p>All races have been provided with a flat 10,000 credit increase to their starting credits. Prior to the increase, average rolls were comparable to taking the starting equipment,\nproviding almost no benefit for gambling.</p>\n<h3>Salarians</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Photographic memory: Proficiency bonus is based only on ability checks for recalling information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<h3>Adepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blackstar</strong>: Biotic Control, Lift and Pull names are swapped (see spells below). Additionally, the Lift portion provides advantage when maintaining the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tactical cloak: Added a duration of 1 minute</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentinels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style</li>\n<li><strong>Bastion</strong>: <em>Assault Armor</em>, clarified the wording of this feature. Added additional saving throws for affected targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vanguards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style</li>\n<li><strong>Shock Trooper</strong>: Biotic Slash now detonates a primed target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Our Barrier changes came about from a spell review. We've slowly working through all of our spells, testing, theory-crafting, and\ndiscussing changes. This process should help clarify spell text and make advanced options more attractive. We've finished cantrips\nand will be working through the other biotic spell levels, tech, and combat in future partial releases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backlash</strong>: Change to a concentration spell, lasts 1 minute</li>\n<li><strong>Charge</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Distance</em>: Removed. Was not as attractive as Barrier Regen</li>\n<li><em>Stunning Blow (new)</em>: Stuns target that fails saving throw. Provides a control option for players not investing in Barrier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Biotic Push</strong>: Removed. Between Throw and Biotic Punch, there was no niche that Biotic Push filled.</li>\n<li><strong>Biotic Pumch</strong>: Flat barrier tick gain. Casting time is an Action.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Siphoning Strike</em>: Gain 10 shield points.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Dark Channel</strong>: Damage reduced to d6. Dark Channel caused equivalent damage to 1st level spells. Instead of transferring to a <em>random</em> creature,\ntransfers to the <em>nearest</em> creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Dark Sphere</strong>: Reduced duration to 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Lash</strong>: Removed barrier tick cost. Set range of 10m.</li>\n<li><strong>Lift</strong>: Has been renamed <em>Pull</em>, as the mechanics of this spell better reflect <em>Pull</em> in Mass Effect 2, 3, and Andromeda</li>\n<li><strong>Pull</strong>: Has been renamed <em>Lift</em> and refactored, becoming a cantrip for moving objects around with a mass effect field.</li>\n<li><strong>Sabotage</strong>: Removed the attack roll, but increased cost. Added saving throw for weapons that are a part of creatures.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Backfire</em>: Replaces Disable. Deals damage back at attacker.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong>: Added duration of 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Slam</strong>: Clarified that this spell can be used on a creature.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Reaction</em>: Replaces Improved Damage. Allows Slam to be cast as a reaction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Slow Fall</strong>: Added advanced options\n<ul>\n<li><em>Improved Duration</em>: 5 min duration</li>\n<li><em>Navigate</em>: Can direct the movement of the fall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Submission Net</strong>: Refactored, the spell text was confusing. Now the focus is controlling targets and preventing Tech casting.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Electrified Net</em>: Allows dealing damage to trapped targets</li>\n<li><em>Anti-Tech</em>: Can cast as a reaction when creature casts tech</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Throw</strong>: Increased damage to d8. Added Medium or smaller restriction to push back.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Radial Blast</em>: Replaces Improved Force. Deals damage to all creatures within 2m sphere of initial target.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ML-77 Missile Launcher</li>\n<li>Added Collector Sniper Rifle</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<p>As the bestiary has grew a problem became terribly evident: there were too many low-CR monsters. If you want numbers, ~90%\nof the bestiary was found between CRs 1/8 and 3. This presents a primary problem for high-level characters because there\nwas a severe lack of content for them to run. So the bestiary &quot;bump&quot; is our redistribution of CRs, increasing the CRs of\nmost monsters. Monsters that have had CR increases have had their stat blocks updated to reflect those changes.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this change is distributing monsters throughout CR levels, which allows more opportunities boss battles\nand improves experience gain. As with most games, killing numerous low-level npcs is never as productive as killing a single\nhigh-level npc. This redistribution gives players across all levels more high-level monsters to fight.</p>\n<p>However, some will find issue that this feels like an overall &quot;nerf&quot; to their characters. I.e., in previous versions\na level 1 character could easily take out a variety of forces Cerberus &amp; Geth Troopers, Husks, etc. The new version\nincreases the difficultly of these &quot;starting&quot; monsters. We understand this is a drastic difference from the game and that\nlevel 1 characters will not feel as powerful. We would like to offer the following reconceptualization of level 1 characters:</p>\n<p>In the games, you play as Shepard, who is a highly-skilled, well-trained solder. You captain a ship and have achieved some\nof the highest ranks in the military. Thus, we see Shepard as a level 12-15 character and his/her ability to easily\nmow down opponents is due to their higher level. As a level 1 character, your still green. You may have some experience\nbut its not enough to easily down a whole platoon of cerberus troopers.</p>\n<p><strong>New</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elcor</li>\n<li>Harvester</li>\n<li>Klixen</li>\n<li>Pyjak</li>\n<li>Thresher Maw</li>\n<li>Varren</li>\n<li>Varren Alpha</li>\n<li>Yahg</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n"},rGOH:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><h2>Races</h2>\n<p>We've got 2 new races, thanks to Ben McPherson!</p>\n<h3>Protheans</h3>\n<p>You'll want to work with your GM on playing a Prothean, as they were wiped out 50,000 years before the first Mass Effect game.\nBut Javik was discover in an undamaged stasis pod, so its possible there are other surviving members of the race throughout\nthe galaxy.

Yes! When designing\nthis sheet we wanted to give a tactile action to starting an encounter. So when you roll for initiative, it means its time\nto flip your sheet and use all the combat information on the back. It's not perfect, there are a lot of class features\nthat act as combat abilities, but this is out first draft. In future iterations we even hope to create class specific\ncharacter sheets.</p>\n</section>\n"},rPDg:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><h2>We're official (kind of...)</h2>\n<p>Tonight we launched our official site name: <a href=\"http://n7.world\">n7.world</a>!</p>\n<p>You can also find us at <a href=\"http://masseffect5e.net\">masseffect5e.net</a></p>\n<p>We waffled between n7.world and <a href=\"http://masseffect5e.net\">masseffect5e.net</a>, landed on the former for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's easy to remember</li>\n<li>'N7' is a classic and recognizable Mass Effect reference, almost synonymous with the game itself</li>\n<li>'World' elicits the idea of roleplaying and being a piece in a larger galaxy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Truth be told, I hastily pushed this change out and even fixed a few links while I was actively running a weekly campaign\n(<em>shame on me as a GM!</em>).

To compensate this change, the 5,000 credit cost for race customization has been removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Galaxy Master</h3>\n<p>Swampson came up with the term 'Galaxy Master' (tm tm tm) or GM. We're using that from now on.</p>\n<h3>Medi-gel</h3>\n<p>Medi-gel should have always been a healing potion instead of the weird mechanics using hit die. Again, the hit die mechanics were neat,\nbut unnecessarily complex.</p>\n<h2>Skill changes</h2>\n<p>Finally, the skill changes were made to accomodate the upcoming Backgrounds and a large vehicle/space travel addition Swampson is working on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hacking</em> renamed <em>Electronics</em> to encompass a wide variety of checks.</li>\n<li><em>Nature</em> renamed <em>Science</em> as a catch-all for scientific intelligence checks. In theory, most information needs can be found with\na quick search on the exonet. This check involves making connections between facts based on experience or intellect.</li>\n<li><em>Piloting</em> renamed <em>Vehicle Handling</em> and base ability changed to Dex. This covers your ability to maneuver vehicles. The GM\ncan also ask for a Wisdom (Vehicle Handling) check when attempting to drive unfamiliar or alien vehicles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Re-aligning with 5e</h2>\n<p>Re-aligning Mass Effect 5th Edition (ME5e) with 5th Edition (5e), where possible, is an on-going process.\nThe first few versions of ME5e were based on cool ideas and not thoroughly play tested. As ME5e evolves, we want to be sure\nit has a balance and doesn't drift too far from the source. In some cases, the drift is necessary, a plethora of weapons and a nod towards\nscience over arcane. In other cases, the drift is intentional to add depth and variety: the expanded armor rules. But in a lot of cases,\nthe drift makes playing ME5e more complicated than intended. We want to fall back on existing 5e rules and only make changes\nwhere the core rules don't have the necessary structures to support this setting. A few examples follow.</p>\n<h3>Omni-tool attacks</h3>\n<p>In v0.5.0, we removed omni-tool attacks. This is a case where I'd simply pulled the idea straight out of ME3, in which each\nclass has its own attack. Though I've received feedback that it was a fun idea, the effect was that each class's default melee\naction was set and not a choice the player can make. However, we still need to replace the ME idea of having an omni-tool attack.\nNothing feels better than picking off a few marauders at range while a group of husks close in on you and, at the last second,\nspawning a blade and cutting those zombies to shreds.</p>\n<p>I never intended to lose this feeling, but I hadn't created the structures to replace it. In v0.5.1, we're halfway there.\nWe've introduced multiple types of Omni-weapons which have the potential to work like the previous omni-tool attacks. First,\nthese weapons don't use a weapon slot (and have a weight 0 if using the Encumbrance rules). In addition, you can draw them with\na free action. So features that grant additional attacks can now be used for these omni-weapons without having to stow or draw\ndifferent weapons.</p>\n<p>Currently there isn't a replacement for the biotic powers (Biotic Push and Punch). These should be available as cantrips\nin the next update. We're also working on providing Engineers with a cantrip-like starting power which can also replace their omni-tool power.</p>\n<h3>Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Another superfluous change was tying armor proficiency to race. This somewhat came from ME1 where certain armor types were only\navailable for certain races, but it didn't add enough to the game. Mechanically, all it did was force some races to take feats in order\nto play their class effectively. It also simply added a 5,000 credit price tag for most armor. No we're back in-line with 5e\nand all armor proficiency and starting equipment is on the class.</p>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<p>Almost all weapon weights have been reduced by 1-2. The exception is a few Heavy Weapons.</p>\n<h3>Omni-weapons</h3>\n<p>Omni-weapons replace void left by omni-tool attacks. They are light weapons that take no weapon slot and take a free action\nto draw. This gives players the option of having a back-up, at-the-ready melee attack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Omni-Taser &amp; Omni-Hammer added</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other weapon changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asari Huntress Sword</strong> &amp; <strong>Asari Warsword</strong> combined into one weapon. Only allows casting of cantrip.</li>\n<li>Cerberus Operator Blade renamed Monomolecular Blade</li>\n<li>M-98 Widow deals double damage to targets not behind cover, replacing the complex and unrealistic 'line-damage' to creatures behind the target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Feats</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Melee Specialist:\n<ul>\n<li>with two-handed ranged weapon, can attack with an omni-weapon</li>\n<li>with one-handed ranged weapon, can attack with light or versatile (w/ one hand) weapon</li>\n<li>only melee, removed +1 AC (benefit available w/ Dual wielder feat)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added Dual Wielder feat</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dual Wield fighting style renamed Gunslinger to avoid confusion with the Dual Wielder feat</li>\n<li>Engineer's <em>Styptic</em> Medi-gel Enhancement increases the potency of the medi-gel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Husk, Str increased to 13, AC increased to 14, CR decreased to 1/8</li>\n<li>Abomination, Str increased to 13, HP increased to 26, CR increased to 1/4</li>\n<li>Collector Captain, Summon Seaker Swarm summons 1d4 swarms at an unoccupied space it can see within 10m.</li>\n<li>Harbinger, Added legendary actions, added melee attack, added Dark Channel to spell list</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cerberus Forces</h3>\n<p>12 unique monsters have been added to the Bestiary which encompass the list of Cerberus forces. It may seem like 3 weeks is\na long time to only have finished 12 monsters, but I need to refactor the underlying weapon code. Originally, I was creating\nduplicate attacks for each weapon. I.e., there was an NPC weapon attack and the weapon itself. But this was creating a lot\nof inconsistent data and needed to be remedied.</p>\n<p>Except for the delay, I am happy with the diversity among this group of NPCs. Adjutants add a bit of 'vampire'-flare to the system.\nPhantoms and Dragoons are a threat up close and hard to hit. Combat Engineers can be troublesome by spawning Turrets. Guardians\nare walking tanks that can take a serious amount of damage. All the while, a Nemesis might be taking pot-shots at you from 80m out.</p>\n<h2>Site Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that showed <code>Shields 0 ( regen)</code> when a monster had no shields.</li>\n<li>Added Distance rule change back into general rules.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug that caused side navigation menu to sometimes not show up.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n"},wGOT:function(e,n){e.exports="<section><h2>News</h2>\n<p>The news is that the News section is gone, replaced by these changelogs. My original idea was to have regular news updates\nwith interesting topics or rule clarifications, but who am I kidding...I've barely got enough time to work on the system, let\nalone making fun blog posts. So I'm scrapping the idea. Maybe I'll get to a point where I can bring it back. But for now,\nall news has been attached to its version.</p>\n<h2>Encounter Builder</h2>\n<p>Thanks to RexThePig who created a spreadsheet of the Mass Effect 5e Bestiary. This spreadsheet can be imported into\nKobold Club's encounter building tool. We've added <a href=\"/for-gms/encounter-builder\">instructions</a> on how to do this.</p>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>The Engineer's Drone ability was ineffective at later levels and didn't scale like other class signature abilities. Summoned drones\nnow benefit from the engineers level with additional hit point and damage/healing.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Drone Jockey subclass was under performing because the drone kept dying in our playtests. We've increased it's\nsurvivability by removing the lightning vulnerability and providing additional hit points and shield points.</p>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<p>Added images to bestiary</p>\n<p>Mass Accelerator Machine Gun attacks are now ranged weapon attacks. This affects the following monsters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sentry Turret</li>\n<li>Turret</li>\n<li>Geth Colossus</li>\n<li>Geth Armature</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Added INT saving throw for the following geth, making them harder to affect with AI Hacking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Geth Armature</li>\n<li>Geth Colossus</li>\n<li>Geth Prime</li>\n<li>Geth Hunter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>YMIR Mech</li>\n<li>LOKI Mech</li>\n<li>FENRIS Mech</li>\n<li>Rachni Worker</li>\n<li>Rachni Soldier</li>\n<li>Rachni Brood Warrior</li>\n<li>Rachni Queen</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Armor Mods</h2>\n<p>Added Jetpacks and Jump Jets, giving players more movement options from armor mods.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>With these spell changes we've officially finished our Biotic Spell review. Special thanks to TheMarmotKing for taking\nthe lead on this. We feel the spells are much more balanced and fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Annihilation Field</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced range to 4m</li>\n<li>I've been wanting to get rid of the -1AC advanced options for a while. The originally represented reduced armor. In Mass\nEffect, that's great, because it effects enemies with &quot;Armor&quot; (i.e., a yellow health bar). But the translation gets muddled when\nmapped onto Armor Class, which is a concept not a physical thing. <em>Disorient</em> isn't that original, but giving anything\ndisadvantage is pretty useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Backlash</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the note that this applies to the triggering attack.</li>\n<li>Changed the wording to allow this to block damage from ranged spell attacks (not just weapon attacks)</li>\n<li>Added note that reflecting damage cannot be triggered by a heavy weapon (they're technically ranged attacks)</li>\n<li>Reduced the higher level hp increase to 10 instead of 20. At +20 hp, a 5th level cast was 75 additional hp...seemed a\nbit much. This also brings the spell in line with 5th's Armor of Agathys.</li>\n<li>In the same vein, removed the additional hp at higher level casts from Durable advancement. Total hp gain on durable\nis now 60 instead of 75.</li>\n<li>Clarified the issue with remaining damage and reflecting damage back at the attacker with &quot;If damage that would be dealt\nto the aegis...&quot;. RAW would be: Aegis has 1HP remaining. Player is hit with a ranged weapon attack for 10 damage. First,\nsplit the damage (5 and 5). 5 is dealt back at the attack. 1 is dealt to the aegis. 4 is dealt to the player.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Biotic Orbs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now a concentration spell, limiting potential spamming of higher level casts and prevents spell from stacking</li>\n<li>Casting a spell costs orbs, clearing up the casting mechanic</li>\n<li>Added action cost to the ranged attack</li>\n<li>Defensive orbs was underpowered compared to improved orbs. Retribution has more potential and works as a panic button\nto get use out of the orbs if the player's concentration fails</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Biotic Sphere</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeps out all hostile creatures, consequently removes the advantage on creatures within it.</li>\n<li>Increased hit points</li>\n<li>Clarifies how the damage and attacks are delegated. Essentially, when you're in the barrier, you can't be hit. The barrier takes all the damage.</li>\n<li>Because this represents an increase in the spells power, and the fact that biotic wall is also a 3rd level spell, this spell was made 4th level</li>\n<li><em>Infuse ammo</em> doesn't reduce the sphere's hp and increased the damage to 1d6</li>\n<li><em>Armored</em> gained resistance to thunder damage. 100 hp with resistance to the most standard damage types seemed a bit much, so reduced the starting hp to 75</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Biotic Wall</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>using cm instead of inches (for consistency)</li>\n<li><em>Shifting wall</em> is a bonus action, not reaction because there was nothing to trigger the reacgion</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dark Sphere</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now the sphere moves at the end of your turn and detonates at the start of your turn if its traveled 20m. This prevents\nthe possibility of the sphere moving at the start of your turn AND detonating.</li>\n<li>Instead of the sphere's explosion causing another primed effect, it now detonates targets.</li>\n<li><em>Control</em> has the option to increase the speed (getting it to 20m in as little as 3 rounds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dominate</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3rd level spell</li>\n<li>Adjusted to work similarly to it's 5th edition counterpart</li>\n<li>Upped psychic damage to make it more attractive</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flare</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased range.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fly</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was an error that showed an old version of Lift for this spell.

The barrier tick cost was removed, but not the auto-hit, making\nthis spell too powerful. The auto-hit has been replaced with a ranged spell attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Singularity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Str save, no dex saves</li>\n<li><em>Necrotic field</em> replaces <em>Damage</em>. It buffs the damage and happens every turn to any creature in the field (despite\nif they're affected by the spell or not). Additionally, they're also primed (necrotic) which would set off 2 detonations\nif the target is also lifted. Necrotic field is a great advancement for people who want to set up combos but don't care\nmuch about the control aspect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stasis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased the range, reduced the duration</li>\n<li>Targets in stasis have damage resistance as they did in the Mass Effect games</li>\n<li>Vulnerable advancement option didn't make sense because of the damage resistance, this was changed to shatter,\nwhich builds up damage over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Storm</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added half damage on successful save</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Warp</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased range.</li>\n<li>Clarified what it meant to stabilize a creature. In 5th, you can only stabilize an unconscious creature, so this simply states what needs to be done.</li>\n<li>Removed the &quot;knocked prone&quot; portion of &quot;Keel Over&quot; as this inhibits ranged attacks. Because of this, it needed to be renamed, Disorient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vortex</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage was lacking. 3rd level AoE spell should be about 31-36 damage.

However, in Mass Effect 5e, a 2nd level spell\nis equivalent to a 3rd/4th level spell in 5th edition. Thus, the following features were allowing very powerful, high-level\ncasts for free.\nBiotic Mastery - limited to 1st level spells\nSignature Biotics - limited to 1st &amp; 2nd level spells</p>\n<h3>Infiltrator</h3>\n<p>With the release of Xanathar's Guide to Everything, many of the following features have been updated or clarified. To match their\n5th edition counterparts, the following features have been updated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shadow\n<ul>\n<li>Sudden Strike</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Saboteur\n<ul>\n<li>Ear for Deceit, Eye for Detail, Insightful Fighting, Eye for Weakness</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vanguards</h3>\n<p>Biotic Slash proved too costly as a subclass feature. It has been replaced with Biotic Fury (Barbarian's Divine Fury)\nand Relentless (Paladin's Relentless Avenger)</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Biotic &quot;Higher Level&quot; spell effects have been doubled. This was a major oversight in the way spell damage was handled. We\nfollow the DMG's recommendations for spell damage, but ME5e spells cap at 5th level. A 1st level spell in this\nsystem is equivalent to a 1st or 2nd level in 5th Edition. 2nd =&gt; 3rd or 4th. Therefore, in this system, when you cast a\n1st level spell as 2nd level, the spell is increased by 2 levels (not 1). Therefore the benefits should be doubled.</p>\n<p>Additionally the range of most spell attacks has been increased.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alter Center Mass</strong>: Increased range\n<ul>\n<li><em>Debilitate</em>: reduces speed and buffs AoE attacks on the target</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Catapult</strong>: Improved spell text.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Salvo</em>: Max to number of targets</li>\n<li><em>Counterstrike</em>: Potential counterspell</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Lance</strong>: Increased Range.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Anti-shield</em> Lighting damage is in addition to force damage (not a replacement)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Nova</strong>: Changed to a cantrip.
