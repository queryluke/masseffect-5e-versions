Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,\nD&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how an\nN7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.\n\n<v-alert :value="true" type="info">\nIn Mass Effect 5e, the Dungeon Master is called the Galaxy Master (tm tm tm)\n</v-alert>\n\n<br>\n\n<v-card><v-card-text>\n__Galaxy Master (GM)__: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile\nlock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite\nside of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defensive system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears\nto be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals\non your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge\nof the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in …\n\\\n__Amanda (playing Melphine)__: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.\n\\\n__Amie (playing Telos)__: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.\nDo I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?\n</v-card-text></v-card>\n\nUnlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’\naction. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,\nroll away from the strike of a biotic blase, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,\nbut the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\n\n<v-card><v-card-text>\n__Galaxy Master (GM)__: OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?\n\\\n__Amanda__: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?\n\\\n__GM__: Make a Wisdom check.\n\\\n__Amanda__: Does my Perception skill apply?\n\\\n__GM__: Of course!\n\\\n__Amanda (rolling a d20)__: Rats. Eight.\n\\\n__GM__: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?\n</v-card-text></v-card>\n\nIn the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other\noperatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,\nthe glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.\nThe operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies\nand relics from a past age.\n\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates\nmissions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the\nentrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?\nPropel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic\'s powers to increase their mass, "affixing" themselves to the surface of \nthe asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM\ncan improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each\nmission can be exciting and unexpected.\n\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a\n__campaign__. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends\nevery week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each\nmonster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also\nearns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.\n\nThere’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.\nTogether, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an\noperative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin.

The GM describes the environment.\nThe GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that\npresent themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).\n\n### 2. The players describe what they want to do.\nSometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different\noperatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol\nspray painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens\nto every player and decides how to resolve those actions.\n\nSometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say\nthat the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some\nother circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what\nhappens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.\n\n### 3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.\n\nDescribing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.\n\nThis pattern holds whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or\nlocked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is\nmore structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is\nfluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.\n\nOften the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal\ndescriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many\nplayers and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the\ngame. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a\nscene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.\n\n### Game Dice\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many\nbookstores.\n\nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,\nand d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).\n\nPercentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different\nten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the\nones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are\nnumbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.\nIn this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.\n\nWhen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.\nFor example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\n\nThe same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the\nnumber rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on\nwhether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)\n\n### The D20\n\nDoes an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari\nbelieve an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation\ngrenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,\nthe game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\n\nEvery character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters\nmight have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are\nthe basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.\n\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of\nthe game. All three follow these simple steps.\n\n#### 1. Roll the die and add a modifier.\nRoll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and\nit sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/character-creation">Step-By-Step Characters</nuxt-link> for details on each ability and how to determine an\nability’s modifier.)\n\n#### 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.\nA class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\n\n#### 3. Compare the total to a target number.\nIf the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,\nit’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\n\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a __Difficulty Class (DC)__. The target number for an\nattack roll is called an __Armor Class (AC)__.\n\nThis simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>\nprovides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.\n\n### Advantage and Disadvantage\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.\nAdvantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you\nhave either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if\nyou have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17\nand a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n\nMore detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#advantage-and-disadvantage">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> section.\n\n### Specific Beats General\nThis compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,\ngadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how\nthe rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\n\nExceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every\nsoldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking\nare more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.\nBiotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.\n\n### Round Down\nThere’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you\nend up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.\n\n\n<source-reference pages="3-4" source="basic"></source-reference>\n',html:'<p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>\n<h3>1.

(Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)</p>\n<h3>The D20</h3>\n<p>Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari\nbelieve an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation\ngrenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,\nthe game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters\nmight have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are\nthe basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>\n<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of\nthe game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>\n<h4>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</h4>\n<p>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and\nit sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/character-creation">Step-By-Step Characters</nuxt-link> for details on each ability and how to determine an\nability’s modifier.)</p>\n<h4>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</h4>\n<p>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>\n<h4>3. Compare the total to a target number.</h4>\n<p>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,\nit’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>\n<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <strong>Difficulty Class (DC)</strong>. The target number for an\nattack roll is called an <strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>.</p>\n<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>\nprovides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>\n<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.\nAdvantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you\nhave either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if\nyou have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17\nand a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#advantage-and-disadvantage">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> section.</p>\n<h3>Specific Beats General</h3>\n<p>This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,\ngadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how\nthe rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every\nsoldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking\nare more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.\nBiotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>\n<h3>Round Down</h3>\n<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset.

Each\ncharacter brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,\nracial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best\nparty of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.\nThe operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.\n\nThe mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic\nsetting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It\nfeatures a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as\nnonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras\nin a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.\n\nOver the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations\nthat they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture\neach other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And\noften, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the\ncurrent situation. Meanwhile, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what\nthey’ll try to do next.\n\nmissions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no\nmore than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other\nchallenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end\nof a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of \'home base\' to rest and enjoy the spoils of\ntheir labors.\n\nBut that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of\nmultiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group\nof operatives following the narrative from start to finish.\n\n### The Three Pillars of mission\n\n__Exploration__ includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations\nthat require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters\nto do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the\ncharacters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city\'s transit tube. On\nthe smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.\n\n__Social interaction__ features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else.

Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental\nmoral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.\n\nIdeals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray?

Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you\'ll sacrifice some\nfocus in exchange for versatility.\n\n### Prerequisites\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your\nnew one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into\nthe infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training\nthat a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that\nis reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\n\n<ai-dialog title="Multiclassing Prerequisites table" component="multiclassing-prereqs-table"></ai-dialog>\n\n### Experience Points\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character\nAdvancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP\nto reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.\n\n### Hit Points and Hit Dice\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a\nclass only when you are a 1st-level character.\n\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same\ndie type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a\nsentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them\nseparately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.\n\n### Proficiency Bonus\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example,\nif you are a soldier 3/infiltrator 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\n\n### Proficiencies\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class\'s starting\nproficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\n\n<ai-dialog title="Multiclassing Proficiencies table" component="multiclassing-profs-table"></ai-dialog>\n\n### Class Features\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don\'t, however, receive the class\'s\nstarting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you\'re multiclassing: Barrier, Extra Attack, and Spellcasting.\n\n<h4 class="mt-3 subheading">Barrier <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h4>\nYour barrier capacity depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your\nindividual levels in those classes. You determine your barrier capacity by adding together all your levels in the\nvanguard class and half your levels (rounded down) in the adept and sentinel classes. Use this total to determine your\nbarrier capacity by consulting the Multiclassing Barrier table.\n\n<ai-dialog title="Multiclassing Barrier table" component="multiclassing-barrier-table"></ai-dialog>\n\n<h4 class="mt-3 subheading">Extra Attack</h4>\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don\'t add together.

If you are an adept 4/engineer 3, for example, you know six 1st-level adept spells and five adept cantrips\nbased on your levels in the adept class. As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer spells. If your Intelligence\nis 16, you can prepare six engineer spells.\n\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that\nclass when you cast the spell.\n\nYou can only use spell slots to cast biotic spells and you can only use tech points to cast tech spells. The exception\nis Sentinels that can use their spell slots to cast biotic or tech spells.\n\n<br>\n\n__Biotic Spell Slots__: You determine your available spell slots and cantrips by adding together all your\nlevels in the adept class and half your levels (rounded down) in the sentinel and vanguard classes.

The participant with\nthe higher check total wins the contest.

A character\'s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster\'s\nskill proficiencies appear in the monster\'s stat block.\n\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character\'s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or\nto stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,\nrespectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related\nto sneaking and hiding.\n\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. No skills are related to Constitution. See an\nability\'s description in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/appendix/skills">Appendix: Skills</nuxt-link> for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\n\n#### Strength\n- Athletics\n\n#### Dexterity\n- Acrobatics\n- Sleight of Hand\n- Stealth\n- Vehicle Handling\n\n#### Intelligence\n- Electronics\n- Engineering\n- History\n- Investigation\n- Science\n\n#### Wisdom\n- Insight\n- Medicine\n- Perception\n- Survival\n\n#### Charisma\n- Deception\n- Intimidation\n- Performance\n- Persuasion\n\n\\\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”\nAt other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,\nproficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that\nskill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\n\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If\nthe character is proficient in Athletics, the character\'s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character\nlacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\n\n<h4 class="m-3 subheading">Variant: Paragon & Renegade <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h4>\nIn Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/beyond-first-level#paragon-renegade">Variant: Paragon & Renegade</nuxt-link>.\nThis new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is "Paragon-ish"\nor "Renegade-ish".\n<p></p>\n\n### Passive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\'t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the\naverage result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when\nthe GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a\nhidden sniper.\n\nHere\'s how to determine a character\'s total for a passive check:\n\n> 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\n\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check\ntotal as a score.\n\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom\n(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the [Dexterity](#dexterity) section below rely on passive checks, as do\nthe exploration rules.\n\n### Working together\n\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who\'s leading the effort - or the one with the\nhighest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.\nIn combat, this requires the __Help__ action.\n\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a\nsecurity system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\'t help another\ncharacter in that task.\n\nMoreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some\ntasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.\n\n#### Group Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.\nIn such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\'t.\n\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,\nthe whole group succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, the group fails. Group checks don\'t come up very often, and they\'re most useful when all the characters\nsucceed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group\nWisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the\nenvironment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of\ndanger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\n<source-reference pages="77-79"></source-reference>',html:'<p>An ability check tests a character\'s or monster\'s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.

If the character\nlacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>\n<h4 class="m-3 subheading">Variant: Paragon & Renegade <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h4>\nIn Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/beyond-first-level#paragon-renegade">Variant: Paragon & Renegade</nuxt-link>.\nThis new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is "Paragon-ish"\nor "Renegade-ish".\n<p></p>\n<h3>Passive Checks</h3>\n<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\'t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the\naverage result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when\nthe GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a\nhidden sniper.</p>\n<p>Here\'s how to determine a character\'s total for a passive check:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check\ntotal as a score.</p>\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom\n(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the <a href="#dexterity">Dexterity</a> section below rely on passive checks, as do\nthe exploration rules.</p>\n<h3>Working together</h3>\n<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who\'s leading the effort - or the one with the\nhighest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.\nIn combat, this requires the <strong>Help</strong> action.</p>\n<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a\nsecurity system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can\'t help another\ncharacter in that task.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some\ntasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.</p>\n<h4>Group Checks</h4>\n<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.\nIn such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren\'t.</p>\n<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,\nthe whole group succeeds.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don\'t come up very often, and they\'re most useful when all the characters\nsucceed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group\nWisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the\nenvironment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of\ndanger.

Even in a space station,\nparticularly a large station or an asteroid colony, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After subduing the\nguards at the entrance to the underground research facility, you consult your omni-tool, which leads you through\nmiles of echoing corridors to a large arena with caged varren."\n\nSometimes it\'s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in\ndays, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the\ncreatures moving and the terrain they\'re moving over.\n\n### Speed <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in meters that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.\nThis number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules\ndetermine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nMass Effect 5e uses meters instead of feet.\n<p class="headline">5ft = 2m</p>\n<p class="headline">On a playmat: 2m = 1 square</p>\n\n### Travel Pace\n\nWhile traveling, a group of operatives can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The\ntable states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes\ncharacters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\n\n#### Forced March\nThe Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\n\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,\nand each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.\nOn a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\n\n#### Mounts and Vehicles\nFor short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted\ncharacter can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are\navailable every 12 to 15 kilometers (8-10 miles), characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very\nrare except in densely populated areas.\n\nCharacters in transports choose a pace as normal. The __range__ statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can\ntravel in a 24 hour period for a _normal_ pace. If you\'re moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a\nslow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.\nIn general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.\n\nMore details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/vehicles">vehicles</nuxt-link> section.\n\n<ai-dialog title="Travel Pace table" component="travel-pace"></ai-dialog>\n\n### Difficult Terrain\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.\nBut operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -\nall considered difficult terrain.\n\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving 1 meter in difficult terrain costs 2 meters of speed - so you can\ncover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\n### Special Types of Movement\nMovement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives\nmight have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\n\n#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling\nWhile climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs 1 extra meter (2 extra meters in difficult terrain), unless a\ncreature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few\nhandholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require\na successful Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n#### Jumping <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\n\n__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to your Strength score divided by three (rounded up)\nif you move at least 4 meters on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.\nEither way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.\n\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\'t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM\'s option,\nyou must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\'s distance),\nsuch as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\n\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\n\n__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 1 + half your Strength modifier\n(rounded up) if you move at least 4m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can\njump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances,\nyour GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\n\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal\nto the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\n\n#### +/- Gravity <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nOperatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that\nis twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. I.e., if your\noperative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.\n\nIf you\'re in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher\ngravity.\n\nWhen in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself.

The rules\nin this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\n\n### Falling\nA fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a\nfall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 4 meters (~10 ft) it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature\nlands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\n\n### Suffocating\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\n\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier\n(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\'t regain hit\npoints or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2\nrounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\n\n### Space <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nThe vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synthorganic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature\nhas some specific resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space without an appropriate environmental\nsuit will remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). After that time passes,\nthe creature immediate becomes incapacitated and it can survive in space a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution\nmodifier (minimum 1) after which it dies.\n\n### Vision and Light\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and\ntargeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character\'s ability to see. Darkness and other effects\nthat obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\n\nA given area might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__. In a __lightly obscured__ area, such as dim light, patchy fog,\nor moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nA __heavily obscured__ area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature\neffectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\n\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: __bright light__, __dim light__,\nand __darkness__.\n\n__Bright light__ lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and\nother sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n\n__Dim light__, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between\na source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts\nas dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.\n\n__Darkness__ creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict\nstarship, or a subterranean ruin.\n\n#### Blindsight\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures\nwithout eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have\nthis sense.\n\n#### Darkvision\nSome creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision\ncan see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that\ncreature is concerned. However, the creature can\'t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n#### Truesight <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that\nare hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).\n\n#### Infrared vision <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nA creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured\nareas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.\n\nHowever, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.\n\n### Food and Water\nCharacters who don\'t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can\'t be\nremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\n\n#### Food\nA character needs about 500 grams (~ 1lb) of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.\nEating 250 grams of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\n\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the\nend of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating\nresets the count of days without food to zero.\n\n#### Water\nA character needs 2 liters (~ 1/2 gallon) of water per day, or 4 liters per day if the weather is hot. A character who\ndrinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at\nthe end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end\nof the day.\n\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\n\n### Interacting with Objects\nA character\'s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM\nthat his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,\nhappens.\n\nFor example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or\ngive the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need\nto hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can\nbypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\n\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,\nbut otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object\'s Armor Class\nand hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.\n(It\'s hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and\nthey are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\n\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n\n<source-reference pages="86-87"></source-reference>\n',html:'<p>Going on missions can involve delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of environmental hazards.

Drawing on your mental\nimage of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.\n\nWhen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:\n\n- Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.\n- Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.\n- Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.\n- Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing\nwhat you see in your mind.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Active Approach to Roleplaying\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying\nshows them.\n\nWhen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role.

A vain asari laps up flattery.\n\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality.\nYou might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence\nthe NPC’s attitude.\n\nInteractions in Mass Effect 5e are much like interactions in real life.

When starting a new mission,\nthe GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your\ncharacter has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond\nyour perception stay in motion.\n\n### Lifestyle Expenses\nBetween missions, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\n\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn\'t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other\nindividuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to\ninfluence the officials of the city than if you live in poverty.\n\n<ai-dialog title="Lifestyle Expenses" component="lifestyle-expenses"></ai-dialog>\n\n### Downtime Activities\nBetween missions, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can\nvary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit,\nand at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be\nconsecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer\nperiod of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\n\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her\ndowntime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\n\n#### Crafting\nYou can craft weapons, mods, armor, other equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the\nobject you are trying to create (typically artisan\'s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations\nnecessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armorsmith\'s tools needs a source of power and intense heat\nin order to craft armor or install mods.\n\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits,\nand you must expend raw materials or omni-gel worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market\nvalue greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500-credit increments until you reach the market value of\nthe item. For example, Blood Dragon Armor (market value 101,300 credits) takes 203 days to craft by yourself.\n\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all\nhave proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1000 credits\nworth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool\nproficiency and the proper facilities can craft the Blood Dragon Armor in 68 days, at a total cost of 50,650 credits.\n\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day, or a comfortable\nlifestyle at half the normal cost.\n\n#### Practicing a Profession\nYou can work between missions, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day.\nThis benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide\ngainful employment you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\n\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn\nenough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\n\n#### Recuperating\nYou can use downtime between missions to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\n\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,\nyou can choose one of the following results:\n\n- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\n- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Researching\nThe time between missions is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over\nthe course of the campaign. Research can include poring over the exonet, buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and\ngossip from their lips, or paying for information from certain factions like the Shadow Broker Network.\n\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will\ntake to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual,\nfile, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation)\ncheck to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone\'s aid,\nor an Intelligence (Electronics) check to hack into a database. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information\nif it is available.\n\nFor each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your\nnormal lifestyle expenses.\n\n#### Training\nYou can spend time between missions training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\n\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more\nability checks are required.\n\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,\nyou gain proficiency with the new tool.\n\n<source-reference pages="88-89"></source-reference>',html:'<p>Between trips to remote planets and battles against reaper forces, operatives need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare\nfor their next mission.

An improvised weapon includes\nany object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.\n\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to\na club (melee weapon). At the GM\'s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were\nthat weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\n\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,\nit also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 6 meters and a long range of 18 meters. Light improvised thrown weapons have ranges of 10m and 30m, and heavy improvised ranged weapons have ranges of 4m and 12m.\n\n\n\n### Thermal Clips <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nRanged weapons (guns) use thermal clips to abate heat.

More information\nabout using thermal clips can be found below.\n\n\n\n### Heavy Weapons <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nHeavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.\n\n#### Targeting\nMost Heavy Weapons also use the Targeting condition. Targeting means painting the battlefield or keeping a lock on one or more creatures for\na single round of combat. Targeting is considered a free action, as long as you\'ve already drawn the heavy weapon,\ni.e., you can choose to pick-up or equip a weapon as your action, then begin targeting as a free action before your turn ends.\nIf you\'re already holding the weapon, you might use an ability as your action and then begin targeting.\n\n\n\n### Carrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nYou can carry 2 weapons into combat unless a feature or armor mod allows you to carry more. If using the Variant: Encumbrance\nrule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.\n\nYou can holster one weapon you\'re wielding or draw one weapon you\'re carrying as a free action.

For\nthe purposes of combat, it represents the number of playmat spaces the vehicle can move on its turn when moving\nat a normal pace.\n\n### Range\nRange represents how far the vehicle can travel in one 24 period. For starships, range is used in conjunction with\nthe Galaxy Map. Each line indicates the travel time between star systems, which you subtract from the starships range.\nTravel to planets within a star systems costs 1 range. You can read more about range for starships in the\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/vehicles#travelling-the-galaxy">Traveling the Galaxy section</nuxt-link>\n\n### Minimum Crew\nThe number of crew required for the vehicle to operate. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be possible to\noperate a vehicle with less than the minimum required number of crew. Rolls made to operate vehicles in these conditions\nwill most likely be made at disadvantage, again at the GM’s discretion.\n\n### Crew Capacity\nThe total number of sentient organisms that a ship can accommodate. This is a combination of active crew and any passengers.\nIn some cases, this number can be expanded by using cargo capacity, below.\n\n### Cargo Capacity\nHow much “stuff” a vehicle can hold. This is measured in Megagrams (also known as a “tonne” or “metric ton”).\n\n__1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 2,204 lbs.__\n\nThis will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg (500 kg). When calculating cargo\ncapacity, we suggest using this as a guideline to estimate cargo capacity rather than getting bogged down in specific\ncalculations. For points of reference, a small hatchback car weighs just over 1 Mg while the largest tanker ships\nin the world have a capacity of over 200,000 Mg.\n\n### Systems\n__Systems__ refer to a number of semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of a vehicle. These are\nthings like navigation, communications, weapons array, etc. These are used to simulate the cooperative effort involved\nin operating larger, complex vessels, and player characters will often be called upon to make skill-based rolls to\noperate these individual systems. Generally speaking, small vehicles, especially those with only a single crew member,\nwill not have designated systems.\n\n### Weapons\n__Weapons__, in many cases, will refer to a specific system or systems on a vehicle. Vehicle-mounted weapons will\ntypically have a multiplier after their damage roll to represent how powerful they are. For example, a cruiser’s mass\naccelerator cannon has a damage roll of 2d6[x100] and an M35 Mako’s coaxial machine-gun has a damage roll of 2d6[x10].\nIn these situations, you roll and add damage dice and any bonuses as usual. After you have determined your result,\nmultiply the total by the amount indicated. In our example, if both weapons roll a __7__ for their damage, the cruiser\ndeals __700__ damage and the Mako deals __70__.\n\n### Size\n\nMost transports use the standard size categories: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. However,\nstarships can become truly colossal and have 4 additional categories.\n\n__Frigates__ are light transport vehicles, usually used for exploration, transportation of small squads, privately\nfunded excursions, or stealth transport. The Normandy is an example of a frigate. Frigates can land on planets and\ntypically host a crew of 5-20.\n\n__Cruisers__ are middleweight ships that can either transport large amounts of supplies from place to place or focus on\nfirepower. Military cruisers tend to be the front-line of the battle and have powerful weapons, shields, and armor.\nCruisers typically have crews of 20 - 100 and are able to land on planets.\n\n__Carriers__, also called _freighters_,\nare large ships meant to carry transports (starfighters and dropships). Carriers are primarily military\nin nature though some venture capitalists have used carriers for mining operations and colonizing efforts. Carriers are\ntypically weak in combat, being slow and lacking much firepower or shielding. Instead, carriers utilize their transports\nfor offense and defense. Carriers are built in space and are too large to land on planets (purposefully). Instead, most\ncarriers use drop ships for planetary exploration. Carriers can support crews in the hundreds.\n\n__Dreadnoughts__ are the largest class of ship, generally a kilometer or more long with incredible firepower that’s\nharnessed in the main cannon which is able to decimate entire cities, squads of enemy fighters, and other dreadnoughts. Dreadnoughts\nare meant for extended life in space, usually hosting a crew in the thousands and a self-sustaining ecosystem of shops,\nleisure activities, police force, politics, etc. Think of dreadnaughts as a small town floating through space. The arks\nof Andromeda were dreadnoughts as are the Liveships that the quarian race inhabits. The ships are so costly to make\nthat the total number of dreadnoughts in the Milky Way is less than 200 with most races having only one or none. It’s\nimpossible to land Dreadnoughts on planets safely.\n\n### Cost\nThe costs listed for vehicles represent their market value. Some vehicles, instead, are __military__ meaning the vehicles\ncannot be purchased on the open market. Instead, characters will need inside connects, the black market, or luck\nto acquire these vehicles.\n\n### CR\nTransports have a CR between 0 and 30, which is based on its hp, ac, and damage. Starships have a __+__ symbol after\ntheir CR, which indicates that this CR is a relative representation based on other starships. It is unlikely that operatives\nwill destroy a starship with traditional weapons. Instead, they\'ll likely have to use other vehicles. For example,\na starship with a CR of __12+__ has the same XP reward as a level CR creature when the operatives destroy it\nusing other vehicles. If operatives did manage to destroy the vehicle using traditional means, we recommend\nproviding XP equal to the standard amount multiplied by 10. For example, a cr 12 creature provides 8,400 XP.

Most actions require the player to be stationed at the necessary __system__. When an\nencounter begins, operatives may choose to “Report to battle stations” and place themselves at a specific system.\n\n### Starship Actions\n\n#### Attack - Weapon System\nMake a ranged attack roll. Do not add your proficiency bonus unless you are proficient with Starship Systems (Weapons).\n\n#### Targeted Attack - Weapon System\nName a system on a target vehicle and make a ranged attack roll. The target’s AC has a +5 bonus against this attack. On\na hit, roll damage and the system is __disabled__ and cannot be used until it is __repaired__. Any creature manning that\nsystem takes damage equal to one half the damage roll.\n\n#### Maneuver - Helm\nMake a DC 15 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check.  On a success, your ship’s AC increases by an amount equal to half\nits speed score until the start of your next turn.\n\n#### Hard Maneuver - Helm\nMake a DC 20 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check.

Creatures\non board your ship cannot take the Move action until the start of your next turn.\n\n#### Repair - Anywhere\nMake a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you patch some damage done to your ship, restoring\n50 hit points.\n\n#### Advanced Repair - Anywhere\nMake a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you manage to repair major damage, restoring 150 hit points.\n\n#### System Repair - Disabled System\nTo take this action, you must be located at a system that is __disabled__. Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check.\nOn a success, the system is repaired and can be used again.\n\n#### Restore - Drive\nMake a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you’re able to reroute power to your shields, restoring 100\nshield points.\n\n#### Harden - EWS\nMake a DC 10 Intelligence (Electronics) check. On a success, you harden the security of your EWS until the start of\nyour next turn.

Tuchanka (the homeworld \nof the Krogan) is part of the Aralakh System, which is one of 3 systems in the Krogan DMZ cluster.\n\n__Note on names__: You may wonder why the names aren’t more “alien”. Our best guess is that the names are either part \nof a human-centered database (in which names were provided to the entries by humans), or that the names have been \ntranslated into similar human-cultured counterparts. For example, the Athena Nebula is home of the Asari, a race of \nandrogynous beings that associate themselves to a female gender. Thus the nebula’s name (in Asari) might be a cultural \nfigure, turn-of-phase, or mystical entity that is best represented as Athena in human culture.\n\n### Traveling between clusters, systems, and planets\n\n<br>\n\n#### Space Transports\nThere four types of transports in the game: land, water, air, and space. To leave a planet or move between planets in a \nsystem requires a space transport. For simplicity\'s sake, travel within a system (from any celestial body to \nanother) takes less than 24 hours. Using the Sol system as an example, a party could leave Earth and arrive at Io, \nEuropa, Pluto, or Sol’s Mass Relay within 24 hours. The GM can adjust this time as they see fit. A rickety ship \nmight move more slowly and require many stops at moons and planets along the way. A very fast ship might make the \njourney from Earth to Pluto within a few hours.\n\n#### Leaving a planet\nThe time it takes to leave a planet varies widely based on how regulated space traffic is on that planet. On urban worlds\nlike Thessia or the Citadel, it can take as long as 2-4 hours to orbit and dock. On uninhabited worlds, your ship can \nland and leave as quickly as the pilot is capable. This can take as little as a few minutes. Finding a safe place to \nland might take a little longer.\n\n#### Starships\nTo travel from system to system, or cluster to cluster, your party will need to use a starship. Every \nstarship has a __range__ attribute which represents the number of system and cluster jumps it can make in a 24 \nhour period. Traveling between systems in a cluster or jumping from one cluster to another takes 1 range.\n\nTraveling between systems is the same as traveling between planets. You can move to any other system within a cluster\nand it costs 1 range. A starship with 3 range that starts on Tuchanka can leave the planet an arrive in\nNith (another system in the Krogan DMZ cluster) within 24 hours. The same starship (with a range of 3) could also leave\nTurchanka, fly to the Nith system, then to the Dranek system (also in the Krogan DMZ cluster), and back to the\nAralakh system within a 24 hour period. If the ship was making stops on planets in each system, it would likely take\nlonger as the ship enters and leaves orbit.\n\nTraveling between clusters requires a __Mass Relay__. Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered throughout the\nMilky Way, forming an enormous network that allows interstellar travel. There is only one Mass Relay per cluster, located\nin a single system which is marked with a * on the map. To travel from cluster to cluster, you must first travel to\nthe system that contains the mass effect relay. Then you can jump to another cluster.\n\nMass Relays are connected as a network, but travel between relays might require additional jumps. I.e., unlike travel\nbetween planets and systems, you can only move between clusters following the lines on the map.\n\n<v-alert type="info" :value="true">\n\n__EXAMPLE TRAVEL__\n\nThe party has been searching for a Prothean device in the Carbonaceous Asteroid (_Phoenix system, Argos Rho cluster_).\nTo collect their reward, they must return the device to a fence on the Citadel.\n\nIn this example, the party has requisitioned a starship with a range of 2. It takes 1 range to move from the\nPhoenix system to the Hydra system which contains the Mass Relay for the Argos Rho cluster. Then it requires 2 Mass\nRelay jumps (Argos Rho > Horse Head Nebula > Serpent Nebula), arriving in the Widow system where the Citadel is located.\nFor our group, this would take as little as 24 but no more than 48 hours to complete the journey.\n\n</v-alert>\n',html:'<galaxy-map :height="$vuetify.breakpoint.smAndDown ? \'80vw\' : \'50vw\'"/>\n<h3>The Milky Way</h3>\n<p>The Milky Way comprises a number of <strong>Clusters</strong> (represented by the yellow, target icons <v-icon>filter_center_focus</v-icon> on the map).\nEach Cluster is composed of <strong>Systems</strong>, and, in turn, each System contains a group of planetary objects (generally a\nstar and any number of planets and their moons, planetoids, asteroids, comets and other celestial bodies).</p>\n<p>For example, Earth is a planet in the Sol System, which is the only system in the Local Cluster.

Every\nstarship has a <strong>range</strong> attribute which represents the number of system and cluster jumps it can make in a 24\nhour period. Traveling between systems in a cluster or jumping from one cluster to another takes 1 range.</p>\n<p>Traveling between systems is the same as traveling between planets. You can move to any other system within a cluster\nand it costs 1 range. A starship with 3 range that starts on Tuchanka can leave the planet an arrive in\nNith (another system in the Krogan DMZ cluster) within 24 hours. The same starship (with a range of 3) could also leave\nTurchanka, fly to the Nith system, then to the Dranek system (also in the Krogan DMZ cluster), and back to the\nAralakh system within a 24 hour period. If the ship was making stops on planets in each system, it would likely take\nlonger as the ship enters and leaves orbit.</p>\n<p>Traveling between clusters requires a <strong>Mass Relay</strong>. Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered throughout the\nMilky Way, forming an enormous network that allows interstellar travel. There is only one Mass Relay per cluster, located\nin a single system which is marked with a * on the map. To travel from cluster to cluster, you must first travel to\nthe system that contains the mass effect relay. Then you can jump to another cluster.</p>\n<p>Mass Relays are connected as a network, but travel between relays might require additional jumps.

However, it is\nencouraged that you and/or your GM create vehicles of their own to use in your campaign. Use the following guidelines\nwhen creating your vehicle.\n\n### Create a concept\nFirst, you'll want to create a concept for your vehicle. What is its main purpose (defense, offense, transport, smuggling, etc)?\nWhat race(s) are associated with the vehicle? Is it unique or mass produced? What does it look like? What size is it?\n\nIf you're looking for inspiration, check out <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/euderion/gallery/40849119/MASS-EFFECT\" target=\"_blank\">Euderion's vehicle creations on DeviantArt</a>.\n\n### Name\nNext, you'll need a good name for your vehicle. Mass produced vehicles typically have some sort of manufacturing number\ncombined with a codename or nickname. If your vehicle is a unique creation, it might have a symbolic name.\n\n### Vehicle Type\nThe vehicle type should be either __transport__ or __starship__. If you've selected transport, designate which\ntransport type it is: __land__, __sea__, __air__, or __space__. Some transports can have multiple types.\n\n### Size\nIf you're creating a transport, choose the size from standard sizes: Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan. For starships,\nchoose one of Frigate, Cruiser, Carrier, or Dreadnought.\n\n### Speed\nA vehicles speed is somewhat abstract. Mechanically, it represents the number of playmat spaces it can move in one turn.\nThis assumes the vehicle is moving an average pace and slow enough to turn and maneuver. Speed should range from 1 to 15.\n\n### Range\nFor transports, range is the number of kilometers the vehicle can travel within 24 hours. This calculation should also\ntake its battery or fuel capacity into account.\n\nFor starships, the range is calculated as ftlu (faster than light units). Essentially how many Mass Effect Relay jumps\nor system to system travel it can complete in 24 hours.\n\n### Cargo\nHow many tonnes can the ship carry? Try thinking about how many mid-size cars can fit into the vehicle or the vehicle tow,\nthis is its Cargo capacity.\n\n### Cost\nWhat is the market rate of the vehicle? It might be that the vehicle is military and not sold on the open market.\n\n### AC\nHow durable is your vehicle's armor? Or how difficult is it to hit? ACs for vehicles generally range from 10 - 25.\n\n### HP & SP\nUse the following table to find the average hull points and shield points. You should adjust the average based on the\nconcept of your vehicle. Was it made for defense? Add more HP. Does it has a state-of-the-art drive, add more SP.\n\n<div class=\"markdown-content\">\n\nType | HP | SP\n--- | --- | ---\nTransport | 150 | 50\nFrigate | 1200 | 250\nCruiser | 2000 | 500\nCarrier | 3500 | 750\nDreadnought | 6000 | 1500\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n### Systems\nNext, you'll want to decide how many systems your vehicle has. You can either make combined systems (for smaller vehicles)\nor have individual systems (for large starships). A system might be so advanced that it requires multiple crew member to\nmaintain.\n\n### Crew\n\n#### Minimum\nTo find the minimum crew, add the number of crew needed for each of the systems.\n\n#### Maximum\nThe maximum crew is generally based on the size of the vehicle\n\n<div class=\"markdown-content\">\n\nType | Max Crew\n--- | ---\nMedium | 1\nLarge | 2-3\nHugh | 6-8\nGargantuan | 10-20\nFrigate | 20-30\nCruiser | 30-100\nCarrier | 100-1000\nDreadnought | 1000+\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n### Weapons\n\nDecide what weapons are equipped on the vehicle. For transports, damage rolls are multiplied by 10 and by 100 for\nstarships. It's also ok for the vehicle to have no weapons.\n\n### CR\n\nTo calculate the CR, you'll need access to the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table in the Dungeon Master's\nGuide, pg. 274.\n\n#### Offensive CR\nFirst, find the offensive CR by calculating the average of all the damaging attacks. If this is a starship, additionally\ndivide the average by 10. Then find the CR associated with that damage on the Monster Stats table.\n\n#### Defensive CR\nNext, find the defensive CR by adding the hull point and shield points together. If this is a starship, additionally,\ndivide the sum by 10. Then find the CR associated with that hit point value on the Monster Stats table. If the AC\nis greater than the AC on the Monster Stats table, increase the defensive CR by 1 for every 2 points above the target AC.\n\n#### Final CR\nThe final CR is the average of the offensive and defensive CR, rounded up. If this is for a starship, notate a __+__ symbol\nbeside the CR.\n\n#### Transport example:\n- AC: 20\n- HP: 250\n- SP: 0\n- Attacks: 35 & 55\n\n__Offensive CR = (35 + 55) / 2 = 45__, corresponds with a CR of 7\n\n__Defensive CR = 250 + 0 = 250__, corresponds with a CR of 12. However, the target AC for CR 12 is only 17. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 13 (+1 because the AC is 20).\n\n__Final CR = (13 + 7) / 2 = 10__\n\n#### Starship example:\n- AC: 25\n- HP: 2500\n- SP: 600\n- Attack: 1100 & 900\n\n__Offensive CR = ((1100 + 900) / 2) / 10 = 100__, corresponds with a CR of 16\n\n__Defensive CR = (2500 + 600) / 10 = 310__, corresponds with a CR of 16. However, the target AC for CR 16 is only 18. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 19 (+3 because the AC is 25).\n\n__Final CR = (16 + 19) / 2 = 17.5 = 18+__\n\n### Additional Details\nFinally, write a short description about your vehicle and notate if it has any special abilities, additional systems,\nor available system slots.\n\n### Share with Us!\n\nIf you'd like to have your creation added, feel free to share it with us!

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round\nrepresents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of\nturns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a\nturn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\n\n### Combat Step by Step\n\n1. __Determine surprise__. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.\n2. __Establish positions__. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the operatives' marching\norder or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries ar - -how far away and in what direction.\n3. __Roll initiative__. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.\n4. __Take turns__. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.\n5. __Begin the next round__. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.\n\n<br>\n\n### Surprise\nA team of operatives sneaks up on a patrolling cerberus squad, springing from behind cargo crates to attack them. A varren\nslinks in the shadows, unnoticed by the operatives until the varren attacks one of them. In these situations, one side of\nthe battle gains surprise over the other.\n\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other.\nOtherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of\neach creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\n\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction\nuntil that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\n\n\n### Initiative\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to\ndetermine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each\nmember of the group acts at the same time.\n\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This\nis the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same\nfrom round to round.\n\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among\ntheir tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally,\nthe GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\n\n\n### Your Turn\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take\nyour action first. Your speed - sometimes called your walking speed - is noted on your character sheet.\n\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section below. Many class features and\nother abilities provide additional options for your action.\n\nThe \"Movement and Position\" section gives the rules for your move.\n\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your\nturn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\"\n\n#### Bonus Actions\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.\nThe Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an infiltrator to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only\nwhen a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You\notherwise don't have a bonus action to take.\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than\none available.\n\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything\nthat deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\n#### Other Activity on Your Turn\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\n\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\n\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.\nFor example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part\nof the same action you use to attack.\n\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some items and other special objects always\nrequire an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\n\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an\nunusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a\npush a large crate into a covering position.\n\n\n\n### Reactions\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an\ninstant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack,\ndescribed later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\n\nWhen you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts\nanother creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n\n<source-reference pages=\"90-91\"></source-reference>",html:"<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of bullets, energy weapons, ducking behind cover,\nslinging biotic and tech spells.

If you can't decide what to do on your\nturn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in &quot;Actions in Combat.&quot;</p>\n<h4>Bonus Actions</h4>\n<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.\nThe Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an infiltrator to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only\nwhen a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action.

For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a\npush a large crate into a covering position.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an\ninstant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack,\ndescribed later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p>\n<p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.

You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your\nturn, following the rules here.\n\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking,\nor they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your\nspeed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\n\n\n\n### Breaking Up Your Move\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you\nhave a speed of 10 meters, you can move 4 meters, take your action, and then move 6 meters.\n\n#### Moving between Attacks\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving\nbetween those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed\nof 10 meters could move 4 meters, make an attack, move 4 meters, and then attack again.\n\n#### Using Different Speeds\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your\nspeeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result\ndetermines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.\n\nFor example, if you have a speed of 10 and a flying speed of 20 because you're wearing a jetpack, you could fly 10 meters,\nthen walk 4 meters, and then leap into the air to fly 6 meters more.\n\n\n\n### Difficult Terrain\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous\nstaircases - the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\n\nEvery meter of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra meter. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space\ncount as difficult terrain.\n\nLow furniture, crates, trash cans, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult\nterrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\n\n\n\n### Being Prone\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves\ndown. In the game, they are <condition id=\"prone\"/>. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes\nmore effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 meters, you must\nspend 5 meters of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\n\nTo move while prone, you must crawl. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra meter. Crawling 1 meter in difficult\nterrain, therefore, costs 3 meters of movement.\n\n### Interacting with Objects\nAround You Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\n\n- draw *or* sheathe a sword\n- open or close a door\n- withdraw a medi-gel from your armor\n- pick up a dropped weapon\n- take a datapad from a table\n- remove your helmet\n- stuff some food into your mouth\n- plant a banner in the ground\n- drink all the ale in a flagon\n- throw a lever or a switch\n- extinguish a small flame\n- put your ear to a door\n- kick a small stone\n- tap the floor with your weapon\n- hand an item to another character\n\n<br>\n\n### Moving Around Other Creatures\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if\nthe creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.\n\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.\n\nIf you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later.\n\n### Flying Movement\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature\nis knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless\nit has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by biotics, such as by the fly spell.\n\n\n\n### Creature Size\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a\nparticular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\n<ai-dialog title=\"Size Category\" component=\"size-category\"></ai-dialog>\n\n<br>\n\n#### Space\nA creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical\ndimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 2 meters wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a\nMedium asari stands in a 2‐meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the asari lets them.\n\nA creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number\nof creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 2-meter\nradius around another one.\n\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around\na Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround\na Gargantuan one.\n\n#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature\ncan squeeze through a passage that's only 2 meters wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra\nmeter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls\nagainst the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.\n\n<source-reference pages=\"91-92\"></source-reference>\n",html:"<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed.

A typical Medium creature isn't 2 meters wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a\nMedium asari stands in a 2‐meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the asari lets them.</p>\n<p>A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number\nof creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 2-meter\nradius around another one.</p>\n<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around\na Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround\na Gargantuan one.</p>\n<h4>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h4>\n<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature\ncan squeeze through a passage that's only 2 meters wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra\nmeter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.

Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\n\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and\nwhat kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\n\n\n\n### Attack\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling\nwith your fists.\n\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.\n\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\n\n\n\n### Cast a Spell\nSpellcasters such as engineers and adepts have access to biotics or tech powers and can use them to great effect in combat.\nEach spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours\nto cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,\nso a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\n\n\n\n### Dash\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after\napplying any modifiers. With a speed of 10 meters, for example, you can move up to 20 meters on your turn if you dash.\n\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 10 meters\nis reduced to 6 meters, for instance, you can move up to 12 meters this turn if you dash.\n\n\n\n### Disengage <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn\'t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,\nthe Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.\n\n\n\n### Dodge <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4>\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack\nroll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.\nYou lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\n\nThe Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.\n\n\n\n### Help\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you\naid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes\nthe check before the start of your next turn.\n\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 2 meters of you. You feint, distract the\ntarget, or in some other way team up to make your ally\'s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before\nyour next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\n\n\n\n### Hide <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4>\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#dexterity">hiding</nuxt-link>.\n\nIf you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later.\n\nHiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.\n\n\n\n### Ready\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take\nthe Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\n\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in\nresponse to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the Blue Suns grunt steps\non the conveyor belt, I\'ll push the button that starts it," and "If the rachni steps next to me, I move away."\n\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember\nthat you can take only one reaction per round.\n\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger\noccurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell\'s magic requires\nconcentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are\nconcentrating on the singularity spell and ready lance, your singularity spell end, and if you take damage before you\nrelease lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\n\n\n\n### Reload <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>\nAll guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.\nWhen you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you\'re currently\nholding, returning the weapon\'s heat to its maximum value.\n\n#### Variant: Rapid Reload\nAt the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.\nMake a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you\'re currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.\nOn a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,\nyour weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.\n\n*Why is this a variant rule?* Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,\nthis variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of\npotential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It\'s up to the GM and players to decide if this rule\nis right for their group.\n\n\n\n### Search\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,\nthe GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\n\n\n\n### Use an Object\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.\nWhen an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.\nThis action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\n\n<source-reference pages="91-92"></source-reference>\n',html:'<p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your\nclass or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

If your speed of 10 meters\nis reduced to 6 meters, for instance, you can move up to 12 meters this turn if you dash.</p>\n<h3>Disengage <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h3>\n<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn\'t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,\nthe Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.</p>\n<h3>Dodge <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4></h3>\n<p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack\nroll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.\nYou lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.</p>\n<p>The Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.</p>\n<h3>Help</h3>\n<p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you\naid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes\nthe check before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 2 meters of you. You feint, distract the\ntarget, or in some other way team up to make your ally\'s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before\nyour next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>\n<h3>Hide <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4></h3>\n<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for\n<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#dexterity">hiding</nuxt-link>.</p>\n<p>If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &quot;Unseen Attackers and Targets&quot; section later.</p>\n<p>Hiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.</p>\n<h3>Ready</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take\nthe Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in\nresponse to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &quot;If the Blue Suns grunt steps\non the conveyor belt, I\'ll push the button that starts it,&quot; and &quot;If the rachni steps next to me, I move away.&quot;</p>\n<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember\nthat you can take only one reaction per round.</p>\n<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger\noccurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell\'s magic requires\nconcentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are\nconcentrating on the singularity spell and ready lance, your singularity spell end, and if you take damage before you\nrelease lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>\n<h3>Reload <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>\n<p>All guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.\nWhen you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you\'re currently\nholding, returning the weapon\'s heat to its maximum value.</p>\n<h4>Variant: Rapid Reload</h4>\n<p>At the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.\nMake a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you\'re currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.\nOn a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,\nyour weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.</p>\n<p><em>Why is this a variant rule?</em> Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,\nthis variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of\npotential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It\'s up to the GM and players to decide if this rule\nis right for their group.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,\nthe GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<h3>Use an Object</h3>\n<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.\nWhen an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.\nThis action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages="91-92"></source-reference></p>\n',attributes:{length:6893,title:"Actions in Combat",change:!0},vue:{render:'return function render() { var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c(\'div\',{staticClass:"frontmatter-markdown"},[_c(\'p\',[_vm._v("When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your\\nclass or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.\n2. __Determine modifiers__. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage\nagainst the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\n3. __Resolve the attack__. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\n\n<br>\n\nIf there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an\nattack roll, you're making an attack.\n\n\n\n### Attack Rolls\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a\nd20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class\n(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its\nstat block.\n\n#### Modifiers to the Roll\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's\nproficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\n\n___Ability Modifier__. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for\na ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse, thrown, or recoil property break this rule. Some spells\nalso require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\n\n__Proficiency Bonus__. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you\nhave proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\n\n#### Rolling 1 or 20\nSometimes lady luck blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a\ncritical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\n\n\n\n### Unseen Attackers and Targets\nCombatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting tactical cloak, or lurking in darkness.\n\nWhen you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing\nthe target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you\ntargeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the\ntarget's location correctly.\n\nWhen a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - -both unseen and\nunheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n\n\n\n### Ranged Attacks\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a gun or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\nshoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\n\n#### Range\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\n\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.\n\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a gun, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack\na target beyond the long range.\n\n#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell,\nor some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature who can\nsee you and who isn't incapacitated.\n\n\n\n### Melee Attacks\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a\nhandheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an omni-tool. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes\nwith its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\n\nMost creatures have a 2-meter reach and can thus attack targets within 2 meters of them when making a melee attack. Certain\ncreatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 2 meters, as noted in their descriptions.\n\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar\nforceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your\nStrength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\n\n#### Gun strikes <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip>\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use your ranged weapon, hitting a target with the butt of\nthe gun. On a hit, a gun strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with\ngun strikes if you are proficient with the type of gun.\n\n#### Opportunity Attacks\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a\nstrike is called an opportunity attack.\n\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the\nopportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs\nright before the creature leaves your reach.\n\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity\nattack when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke\nan opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if an adept lifts you off the ground with Pull.\n\n#### Two-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a\nbonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your\nability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\n\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\n\n\n### Contests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This\nsection includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The\nGM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\n\n#### Grappling\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.\nIf you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least\none free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics)\ncheck contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).\nIf you succeed, you subject the target to the <condition id=\"grappled\"/>. The condition specifies the things that end it,\nand you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\n\n__Escaping a Grapple__. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics)\nor Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n__Moving a Grappled Creature__. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is\nhalved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\n#### Shoving a Creature\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it\naway from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll,\nyou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check\n(the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 2 meters\naway from you.\n\n<source-reference pages=\"94-96\"></source-reference>\n",html:"<p>Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an\nattack has a simple structure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage\nagainst the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an\nattack roll, you're making an attack.</p>\n<h3>Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a\nd20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class\n(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its\nstat block.</p>\n<h4>Modifiers to the Roll</h4>\n<p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's\nproficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p>\n<p>_<strong>Ability Modifier</strong>. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for\na ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse, thrown, or recoil property break this rule. Some spells\nalso require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong>. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you\nhave proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>\n<h4>Rolling 1 or 20</h4>\n<p>Sometimes lady luck blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p>\n<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a\ncritical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p>\n<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.</p>\n<h3>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h3>\n<p>Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting tactical cloak, or lurking in darkness.</p>\n<p>When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing\nthe target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you\ntargeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the\ntarget's location correctly.</p>\n<p>When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - -both unseen and\nunheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a gun or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\nshoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p>\n<h4>Range</h4>\n<p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p>\n<p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.</p>\n<p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a gun, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack\na target beyond the long range.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4>\n<p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell,\nor some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature who can\nsee you and who isn't incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Melee Attacks</h3>\n<p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a\nhandheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an omni-tool. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes\nwith its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>\n<p>Most creatures have a 2-meter reach and can thus attack targets within 2 meters of them when making a melee attack. Certain\ncreatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 2 meters, as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar\nforceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your\nStrength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h4>Gun strikes <v-chip color=\"secondary\" text-color=\"white\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">new</v-chip></h4>\n<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use your ranged weapon, hitting a target with the butt of\nthe gun. On a hit, a gun strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with\ngun strikes if you are proficient with the type of gun.</p>\n<h4>Opportunity Attacks</h4>\n<p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a\nstrike is called an opportunity attack.</p>\n<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the\nopportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs\nright before the creature leaves your reach.</p>\n<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity\nattack when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke\nan opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if an adept lifts you off the ground with Pull.</p>\n<h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>\n<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a\nbonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your\nability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>\n<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>\n<h3>Contests in Combat</h3>\n<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe.

The thrust of a sword,\na well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from an incinerate spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the\nhardiest of creatures.\n\n\n\n### Hit Points\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more\nhit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\n\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum\ndown to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on\na creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\n\n__Shield Points__. Creatures wearing armor also benefit from __shield points__ described below.\n\n\n\n### Damage Rolls\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any\nmodifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\nWith a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\n\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier - the same modifier used for the attack roll - to the damage.\nA spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\n\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.\nFor example, when an adept casts vortex or an engineer casts flamethrower, the spell's damage is rolled once for all\ncreatures caught in the blast.\n\n#### Critical Hits\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the\nattack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can\nroll all the damage dice at once.\n\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a monomolecular blade, roll 2d10 for the damage, rather than 1d10, and then\nadd your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the infiltrator's Sneak Attack feature,\nyou roll those dice twice as well.\n\n#### Damage Types <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip>\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules\nof their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\n\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\n\n<ai-dialog title=\"Damage Types\" component=\"damage-types\"></ai-dialog>\n\n<br>\n\n### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\n\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or\nan object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\n\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance\nto bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tech aura\nthat reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example,\nif a creature has resistance to force damage as well as resistance to biotic damage, the damage of a biotic force damage\nis reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\n\n\n### Healing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through experimental cloning. Rest can\nrestore a creature's hit points, and medical methods such as a medi-gel or first aid spell can remove damage in an instant.\n\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit\npoints can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, an\nengineer grants a sentinel 8 hit points of healing. If the sentinel has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum\nof 20, the sentinel regains 6 hit points from the engineer, not 8.\n\nA creature that has died can't regain hit points.\n\n\n\n### Dropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\n#### Instant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die\nif the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\n\nFor example, a solider with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack,\nshe is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the soldier dies.\n\n#### Falling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you\nregain any hit points.\n\n#### Death Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to\ndetermine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any\nability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of\nsucceeding on a saving throw.\n\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself.\nOn your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't\nneed to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when\nyou regain any hit points or become stable.\n\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20\non the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\n\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If\nthe damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum,\nyou suffer instant death.\n\n#### Stabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be\nstabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.\n\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a\nsuccessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\n\nA stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.\nThe creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable\ncreature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\n#### Monsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make\ndeath saving throws.\n\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and\nfollow the same rules as player characters.\n\n\n\n### Knocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature\nto 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the\ninstant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\n\n\n### Temporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points;\nthey are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\n\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage\ncarries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the\ntemporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\n\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character\ncan, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\n\nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive\nmore of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a drug grants you\n12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\n\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can\nstill absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.\n\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\n<source-reference pages=\"96-98\"></source-reference>",html:"<p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.

Rest can\nrestore a creature's hit points, and medical methods such as a medi-gel or first aid spell can remove damage in an instant.</p>\n<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit\npoints can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, an\nengineer grants a sentinel 8 hit points of healing. If the sentinel has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum\nof 20, the sentinel regains 6 hit points from the engineer, not 8.</p>\n<p>A creature that has died can't regain hit points.</p>\n<h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>\n<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>\n<h4>Instant Death</h4>\n<p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die\nif the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>\n<p>For example, a solider with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack,\nshe is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the soldier dies.</p>\n<h4>Falling Unconscious</h4>\n<p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you\nregain any hit points.</p>\n<h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>\n<p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to\ndetermine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any\nability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of\nsucceeding on a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself.\nOn your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't\nneed to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when\nyou regain any hit points or become stable.</p>\n<p>Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20\non the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If\nthe damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum,\nyou suffer instant death.</p>\n<h4>Stabilizing a Creature</h4>\n<p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be\nstabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>\n<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a\nsuccessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>\n<p>A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.\nThe creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable\ncreature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>\n<h4>Monsters and Death</h4>\n<p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make\ndeath saving throws.</p>\n<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and\nfollow the same rules as player characters.</p>\n<h3>Knocking a Creature Out</h3>\n<p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature\nto 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the\ninstant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p>\n<h3>Temporary Hit Points</h3>\n<p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points;\nthey are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>\n<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage\ncarries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the\ntemporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>\n<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character\ncan, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>\n<p>Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive\nmore of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a drug grants you\n12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>\n<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can\nstill absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p>\n<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"96-98\"></source-reference></p>\n",attributes:{length:9433,title:"Damage and Healing"},vue:{render:'return function render() { var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c(\'div\',{staticClass:"frontmatter-markdown"},[_c(\'p\',[_vm._v("Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.

You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,\nprovided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\n#### Reactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response\nto some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\n#### Attack action\nMany Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If\na spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.\n\n#### Longer Casting Times\nCertain spells require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than\na single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your\nconcentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot or\nspend tech points. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\n\n\n### Range\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like lance, the target is a creature. For a spell\nlike havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.\n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.\nOther spells, such as the fortification spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\n\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin\npoint of the spell's effect must be you.\n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.\n\n\n\n### Components <v-chip color=\"orange accent-2\" text-color=\"black\" class=\"v-chip--x-small\">change</v-chip>\nIn Mass Effect 5e, all spells are Somatic, meaning they require some amount of gesturing. To cast any of the spell types\na caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nThere are no other spell components (such as verbal or material, as in D&D).\n\n\n\n### Duration\nA spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or\neven years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\n#### Instantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't\nbe dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.\n\n#### Concentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.\nIf you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long\nyou can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\n- __Casting another spell that requires concentration__. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that\nrequires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.\n- __Taking damage__. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving\nthrow to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take\ndamage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n- __Being incapacitated or killed__. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n- The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as getting sucked out of an airlock, require you\nto succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n\n<br>\n\n### Targets\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description\ntells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n\n#### A Clear Path to the Target\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect\nat a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes\ninto being on the near side of that obstruction.\n\n#### Targeting Yourself\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically\na creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect\nSpells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\n\n\n### Areas of Effect\nSpells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,\ncylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts.\nThe rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in\nspace, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n\nA spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point\nof origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n\n#### Cone\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal\nto that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n#### Cube\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as\nthe length of each side.\n\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n#### Cylinder\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description.\nThe circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight\nlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then\nshoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n\nA cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.\n\n#### Line\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n\nA line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n#### Sphere\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as\na radius in feet that extends from the point.\n\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.\n\n\n\n### Saving Throws\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies\nthe ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n\nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n\n\n\n### Attack Rolls\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.\nYour attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll\nif you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.\n\n\n\n### Casting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the\narmor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\n<source-reference pages=\"101-104\"></source-reference>\n",html:"<p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class, the type of spell,\nor the spell's effects.</p>\n<p>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, casting time, range, and duration.\nLevel and load are provided for biotic and tech spells, respectively.</p>\n<p>The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p>\n<h3>Casting Time</h3>\n<p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or even longer to cast.\nCombat spells can require an Attack action to cast.</p>\n<h4>Bonus Action</h4>\n<p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift.

If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p>\n<h4>Attack action</h4>\n<p>Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If\na spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.</p>\n<h4>Longer Casting Times</h4>\n<p>Certain spells require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than\na single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your\nconcentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot or\nspend tech points. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like lance, the target is a creature. For a spell\nlike havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.</p>\n<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in meters.

A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or\neven years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>\n<h4>Instantaneous</h4>\n<p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't\nbe dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.</p>\n<h4>Concentration</h4>\n<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.\nIf you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p>\n<p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long\nyou can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>\n<p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration</strong>. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that\nrequires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Taking damage</strong>. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving\nthrow to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take\ndamage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed</strong>.

But this conversion seems to be generating interest, \nand that ain't nothing. Thus, I've got a renewed motivation (urgency?) to get some major work done in the next few months.\nAnd thanks to everyone who has taken a gander.\n\nBut first...\n\n# Playtesting\n\nWe had 3 players with the following loadouts:\n\n1. Drell Marksman Soldier\n2. Asari Justicar Adept\n3. Human Saboteur Infiltrator\n \nWe ran a fast-paced session, testing the classes out on creatures, \nmobs I pulled straight from D&D, bosses (a Banshee), and 2 fully spec'ed NPCs (Sentinel & Engineer).\nWe leveled quickly so we could check out the classes at different phases. Specifically, level 5, 9 and 12.\nOverall, the flow, battle mechanics, spells, etc. all had the necessary feel of both ME and D&D. I was excited to see\nthat they melded together nicely. I even started on a bestiary, creating monsters for various Reaper mobs, including\nMarauders, Cannibals, Husks, and a Banshee. If you're so inclined, [check out my prep notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19iMxTqyu7Vtyqy3I2-INWwurnXea_YuKzy7HbMZMuXw) \nfor the very short campaign. **Note**: we didn't get to Operation Driftwood, and we chose Operation Metal Detector.\n\n## What's next\n\nI've been quietly working on a key aspect of any game system: **balance**. For the past months, I broken ye 'ole spreadsheets,\nworking on class analysis and overhauling the classes. \n\n**Issue 1**: Some classes vastly outperformed others. \n\n**Issue 2**: Classes peaked around level 9, with nominal damage increase beyond level 12.\n\nI found a D&D class analysis in [The Optimists' Guide to D&D 5E Damage by Class, Subclass, Weapon, and Level](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIrEV1RFv6yxWEdqG6zP3z-ZONDTacquGyqYj8G-CdE).\nIt gave me a framework to review the ME classes. In doing the work, I also tried to align the classes more closely with\nD&D counterparts. Soldiers became more like Fighters, Adepts like Wizards, Sentinels like Paladins. Other minor updates include\na better variety of weapons stats and improving/standardizing spell text.\n\nAll in all, the next iteration will _look_ similar but be a huge overhaul. Rest assured, I'll be sure to make the current \nversion available on the site, in case anyone is running a campaign.\n\n## Other things in the works\nGeneral site fixes, a bestiary, armor, adding new spells, printable spell cards, and adding some sort of \"NPC maker\".\n\n\nThis endeavor is far from over...\n\n## Shoutout\nMajor thanks to [SleightxHope](https://github.com/SleightxHope) for jumping into Github and contributing a ton of ideas.\nBackgrounds, skills, armor, weapon mods, class rewrites! Can't say thanks enough for the collaboration and playtesting!\n\n## Why so much change?\nOne major issue was that almost all classes peaked around lvl 9.

FYI - Those sheets are sorely\nout of date, as I threw in a plethora of changes last minute. But that's the documentation\nfor how the new classes stack up damage wise.

So, in this iteration, I focused\non taking subclass features from 5e and sticking them in at appropriate levels. There is\nstill plenty of homebrew content, but the classes should have a much more familiar feel than before.\n\n\n## Player's Manual\nTo keep things more sustainable, I've completely rewritten the [player's manual](/phb/intro) into a single page webapp. This\npart of the site will now exist to keep people updated on news, play testing, and other miscellaneous items, like printable character sheets\nand spell cards.\n\n**NOTE:** If you see any spelling errors or come across any bugs, please [add an issue in the repo](https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues)\n\n\n## Changes\n\n### Rules\nMostly clarifications with a few minor updates.\n\n#### Weapons\n\n**Weapon Handling**\n\n* Reloading takes an action\n* Holstering and drawing a new weapon is a bonus action\n\n**Weapon Stats**\n\n* Made the **Rof & Heat** stat simpler. Instead of subtracting RoF from Heat, heat is now the number of times you\n  can fire the weapon before you need to reload.\n* **Rare** Weapons. Basically a way of saying lvl 1 PCs shouldn't have access to these weapons.\n\n**Weapon Attributes**\nWeapons now have different types of attributes like \"Arc\" and \"Hip Fire\" which give the weapon additional combat perks.\n\n**Removed Hip Fire**\nThe previous version gave all weapons advantage in melee range. Now only Hip Fire weapons have advantage in melee range.\nThe standard D&D rule applies that all other ranged weapons have disadvantage in melee range.\n\n\n#### Armor\nExpanded the Armor section. Currently working on pre-made armor sets and armor mods.\n\n\n#### Consumables\nIt never felt \"right\" that grenades and ammo powers were \"spells\". So I've made them consumables. Consumables\nare kind of like magic items. They have an associated rarity (how often you'll get access to them) and are gone\nonce you use them.\n\n**Medi-gel**\n...has been added. Lets you use a hit die in combat. See Rules > Consumables in the PHB.\n\n#### Skills\nNew Skills: **Engineering**, **Xenology**\n\n### Races\n**Geth**\nI took away a few of the Tech powers that came from geth classes in ME3 Multiplayer mode and made them geth only.\nRepair Matrix and Hunter Mode didn't really make sense for organic creatures. In addition, geth get some really nice\nclass-specific features at level 11. This is to make up for the fact that geth cannot take any feats.\n\n**Quarians**\nRemoved Improvised Grenade and added Cybernetic Augmentation. Read about the latter in the codex and felt the Imp grenade was\nlame.\n\n**Salarains**\nMade Photographic Memory much more powerful, cosidering this is one of the weakest races. Great for Skill Monkeys though!\n\n\n\n### Classes\nTo be honest, so much has changed with the classes, the best I can do is give you an overview of each one. I'm also providing\na % done. By this, I mean how much the class __feels__ complete, which should also be an indication of how much it's likely to change\nin the future.\n\n#### General\n**Damage!**\n\nA major issue in the previous iteration was that every class's damage output stopped scaling around level 10. This\nhas been fixed. It also meant implementing a new Max TP system for Engineers, Infiltrators, and Sentinels. Basically, as you\nlevel, you can spend more TP on your Tech Powers.\n\n**Combat Powers**\n\nI added in Combat Powers, which are mechanically like class features (generally only use them once per short/long rest),\nbut give you the customizing feel of spells and tech powers, i.e., you can choose which ones you want. Soldiers choose\nCombat powers as they progress, but Infiltrators can take a few as well instead of learning a tech power. I hope to expand\nthe crossover list further.\n\n#### Adepts\n**90%**\nBrought adepts much more in line with Wizards, borrowing a lot of class and subclass features from D&D.\n\n#### Engineers\n**90%**\nPrimarily worked on the Support subclass, giving it more variety.\n\n#### Infiltrators\n**75%**\nRedistributed and added more of the Rogue features from D&D. Still feels like it could use a little bit more work.\n\n#### Sentinels\n**60%**\nI feel like tech armor changes every time I sit down to do edits. I need to do a lot more playtesting with Sentinels and\nall subclasses before I can put a button in it.\n\n#### Soldiers\n**85%**\nProbably the most drastic overhaul, getting rid of adrenaline dice, reworking the subclasses, adding combat powers,\nand making them progress more like fighters. I'm mostly happy with the outcome.\n\n#### Vanguards\n**75%**\nUpdated subclasses and tried to make them more melee heavy. A mix of Paladins, Barbarians, and Fighters. Could still use\nsome work.\n\n### Feats\nAdded a new Feat: Grenadier. Hoping to add a few more in the near future.\n\n### Backgrounds\nSleightxHope provided all of these. Will try to add more soon.\n\n### Spells\nAlso major overhauls.\n\nWell, I think that's everything. This has been a hell of sprint to get all the edits in, but I think it's at a much more stable\nplace where we can slow add new feature and adjust classes. Thanks to anyone out there who is playing!\n\n\n",html:"<p>I randomly decided to checkout the analytics for this site and came across a surprising and exciting find: <em>people are\nvisiting this site!!!</em> It's not a ton of people, averaging ~30 a day.

Specifically, level 5, 9 and 12.\nOverall, the flow, battle mechanics, spells, etc. all had the necessary feel of both ME and D&amp;D. I was excited to see\nthat they melded together nicely.

Now it has:\n\n```\nInstead of making a ranged weapon attack, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + DEX modifier). If you are\nproficient with Assault Rifles, add your proficiency bonus to the DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful one.\n```\n\nDamage was also scaled back, but not too much. Originally, the conversion was that all "automatic" weapons had a 5-6 Rate of Fire(RoF), but 5-6 damage die is A LOT.\nShotguns also had a high RoF accounting for the amount of bullets in a single blase, which created ambiguity between fire rate and bullet count.\nThree-round burst weapons has 3, Semi-auto has 2, and there were a few single shot, like sniper rifles. This also created a very large\nspread on the damage tables.\n\nIn the refactor, there is a new weapon type: "Semi-automatic". By default these only have an RoF of 1, but you can use your bonus\naction to fire another shot. This makes the standard D&D 5e dual wielding mechanic more accessible, i.e., if you\'ve got a\nsemi-automatic weapon, you can make a second attack as a bonus action.\n\nThree-round burst weapons have an RoF of 3, and automatic and RoF of 4, with a few minor exceptions for weapons that had\nridiculously higher RoFs in the game like the Tempest SMG and a few Heavy Weapons.\n\nThe end result is more generalized weapons by type that have enough variety in range, heat, and mechanic to make your choice fun:\n\n* Assault Rifles: Vary more than any other weapon type but are generally automatic with lower heat and a medium range\n* Heavy Pistols: Semi-automatic, light, with high heat and medium range\n* Shotguns: Short range power houses with low heat but a variety of punch.\n* SMGs: Short range, high RoF, low damage.\n* Sniper rifles: Long range & high damage with limited RoF and Heat.\n\nRare weapons have an increased cost (20k credits). This should make them unattainable to low level players and\ngives them a monetary cost to their awesomeness. Obviously, GMs can adjust cost to their needs.\n\nAnd finally, this version includes new melee weapons!\n\nMelee weapon attributes work exactly like their D&D 5e counterparts (finesse, light, thrown, versatile, reach, etc). Most weapons have a special\nability as well. However, to replace the "proficiency" aspect of melee weapons (since there are so few), there is a STR requirement.\nAnyone can wield a melee weapon, but if you don\'t have the required STR mod (matching or above) your melee attacks with the weapon are\nmade at a disadvantage.\n\n## New Spells\nA host of new spells and tech powers have been added. Primarily these were based on 5th edition, adding a bit more variety\nthan simple damage dealing abilities, and adding more options for Vanguards and Sentinels.\n\n## Spell damage\nWith a few exceptions, damage for all damage dealing biotic spells have been adjusted to fit the following criteria:\n\n* Cantrips: < 10 avg damage\n* 1st Level: 10-15 avg damage\n* 2nd level: 15 - 22 avg damage\n* 3rd level: 20 - 28 avg damage\n* 4th level: 25-35 avg damage\n\nThis change was made to add a bit more scaling to the spells, as 4th level spells are effectively 6-7th level D&D spells.\n\n## Class changes\nA few class changes, primarily in name. Vanguards received some tweaking. Cabals are a very specific Turian Vanguard,\nso it didn\'t make much sense for them to be a subclass. Thus, Cabals have become Nemesis vanguards, a caster-oriented flavor.\n\n## New Race\nUnshackled AI, a slight variant from Geth. Are you a rogue AI or a corporate masterpiece?

Players may attempt to reload as a bonus action.\n* Primer and Detonator rules added as variant rule.\n\n### Thermal Clips\n* New thermal clips added: Drill, Explosive, Phasic\n* Thermal clip mechanics changed to account for addition of primer and detonators.\n\n### Armor Mods & Sets\nArmor or mods that granted an increase in shield regen die type, now increase shield regen by 5.\nArmor sets that had +shield points, have the total shields and regen amount listed.\n\n\n### Shields\n* Shields\n  * Flat temporary HP that no longer increase with level\n  * Gained from armor and items, not inherent to the player character\n  * Regenerate fully on a short/long rest\n  * Regenerate in combat if the player takes the Dodge or Hide action then takes no damage until the start of the player's next turn.\n\nSomething that's been nagging me for some time is the shield mechanic. The idea was this: shields make up half of a\nplayer's health and slowly regenerate if they don't take damage. Sounds great, right? But a simple, great sounding idea\ncan get complicated quickly. The first major hurdle was divvying up player health. Trying to 'split dice' resulted in\na total health pool about 10% higher than in 5th edition. When I factored in the average rate of shield\nregen the increase jumped to more than 25% higher.\n\nMore importantly, rolling each turn to get shields back wasn't very exciting and took up a lot of time. Each round of\ncombat, players had to think: _did I take damage? I didn't..._ [rolls dice] _...oh, goody, 2 sp I need track_. I found\nthat players actively choose _not_ to roll because they didn't really care for the benefit.\n\nThe final problem was the mechanic didn't fit the fiction. What happens when a player removes their armor? Do they still have shields?\nWhat is the underlying effect that causes you to gain more shields when you level up?\n\nThrough discussions with Swampson, we cam up with an alternative that we believe fixes all of these problems:\n\n1. Shields no longer level up with the character.\n2. Shields are a small regenerating pool of temporary hp.\n2. Shields come standard in all chest armor pieces, with a base of 5 shield points and a regen of 5. Both can be increased with mods.\n3. Shields only recharge an amount equal to their regen when the character takes the Hide or Dodge action and then takes no damage until the start of their next turn.\n\n#1 & #2 fix the health and fiction issues. But I'm especially excited about #3. The idea of hiding or dodging to recharge\nyour shields is a great reflection of Mass Effect combat. Plus, the reward has more potential for the player. Although, 5 additional\nhit points doesn't sound like a lot, it is for a level 1 character wearing standard armor, and as players level up they can\nget upwards of 30-40 shield points via upgrading their armor. What I really enjoy is that players now have an\nactive choice in regaining shields, but there is still some luck involved.\n\nMechanically, I'm also a fan of how well this mechanic blends with the existing 5th edition rules. Instead of a more\ncomplex set of hp, shields are akin to a cantrip that provides temporary hp. The increase in health isn't too much to break\nthe system, but enough to help mitigate the lack of healing spells.\n\nIf you've got any thoughts on this change, feel free to use the [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1).\n\n## Spells & Powers\nAny spell effect that had a player 'gain shield points', now only effects players wearing armor.\n* Annihilation Field: __Drain__ option replaced with __Phasic__, which bypasses shields.\n* Shocking touch: __Absorbing Shock__ option replaced with __Reach__, increasing the range of the power.\n* Siege Pulse: Shield point cost reduced to 5.\n\n## Races\n\n### Geth\n* Hunter Mode: No longer reduces shields. Movement increase reduced to 2m, attack bonus reduced to +1. Soldier class bonus reduced to only necrotic and force damage resistance.\n\n## Bestiary\nCollector forces added.\nReaper forces added (excluding Reaper Destroyers and Reaper Capital Ships).\n\nAs mentioned in my previous post, I've still been working on the bestiary. My goal is 100 unique monsters and npcs by the end\nof April (no promises!). For now, I am happy to be able to give you the Reaper and Collector forces. Before you get too excited,\nno, this does not include a Reaper. That's a task that will take extensive play testing. But, with the random grunt generator,\nI hope this is enough to get you started on a fun campaign. From here on out, instead of a huge drop in April, I'll add\nfactions as I complete them. Cerberus is next, followed by the Geth, then the mercenary factions (Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack).\nFinishing out the bestiary with some aliens, re-skined 5th edition monsters that I think fit well into the universe, and some\nnamed NPCS. When I finally do drop a Reaper stat block into the mix, I'm sure I'll have a very long post explaining my choices,\nmath, and play testing notes.\n\n## Site improvements\n\nProbably least exciting to the average user (but exciting for me) are the minor site enhancements I've added.\nSpells, weapons, monsters, and grunts can now be bookmarked for quick reference. Conditions and some rule references\nnow have tooltips. And we've added spell cards to the [Printables](/assets) section. Special\nthanks to Swampson for banging those out. We're not 100% on the layout and style, but when we are, we'll release a\nprinting guide to go along with them.\n\n* Rule dialogs added for quick reference.\n* Tooltips added for conditions\n* Special thermal clips added as possible npc feature in the grunt generator.\n* Spell cards added to printables section\n* Bookmarks allow you to save spells, weapons, and npcs for quick reference\n",html:"<h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reloading updated.

It's easy to remember\n2. 'N7' is a classic and recognizable Mass Effect reference, almost synonymous with the game itself\n3. 'World' elicits the idea of roleplaying and being a piece in a larger galaxy.\n\n\nTruth be told, I hastily pushed this change out and even fixed a few links while I was actively running a weekly campaign\n(_shame on me as a GM!_). So if there are any issues you come across you can either use the [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1)\n__OR!__ ping me on my fresh email: [luke@n7.world](mailto:luke@n7.world)\n\nI've got more system updates coming out next weekend at the latest. As word spreads about this system, we continue to gain a group\nof active contributors who are generating a ton of great new ideas.\n\nThanks to everyone!\n\n## General\n* Shields regenerate after combat in addition to a short or long rest, or by taking the Hide or Dodge action\nand taking no damage.\n* Armor proficiency moved back to the class (not race). To compensate this change, the 5,000 credit cost for race customization has been removed.\n\n### Galaxy Master\nSwampson came up with the term 'Galaxy Master' (tm tm tm) or GM. We're using that from now on.\n\n### Medi-gel\nMedi-gel should have always been a healing potion instead of the weird mechanics using hit die. Again, the hit die mechanics were neat,\nbut unnecessarily complex.\n\n## Skill changes\nFinally, the skill changes were made to accomodate the upcoming Backgrounds and a large vehicle/space travel addition Swampson is working on.\n\n* _Hacking_ renamed _Electronics_ to encompass a wide variety of checks.\n* _Nature_ renamed _Science_ as a catch-all for scientific intelligence checks. In theory, most information needs can be found with\na quick search on the exonet. This check involves making connections between facts based on experience or intellect.\n* _Piloting_ renamed _Vehicle Handling_ and base ability changed to Dex. This covers your ability to maneuver vehicles. The GM\ncan also ask for a Wisdom (Vehicle Handling) check when attempting to drive unfamiliar or alien vehicles.\n\n## Re-aligning with 5e\n\nRe-aligning Mass Effect 5th Edition (ME5e) with 5th Edition (5e), where possible, is an on-going process.\nThe first few versions of ME5e were based on cool ideas and not thoroughly play tested. As ME5e evolves, we want to be sure\nit has a balance and doesn't drift too far from the source. In some cases, the drift is necessary, a plethora of weapons and a nod towards\nscience over arcane. In other cases, the drift is intentional to add depth and variety: the expanded armor rules. But in a lot of cases,\nthe drift makes playing ME5e more complicated than intended. We want to fall back on existing 5e rules and only make changes\nwhere the core rules don't have the necessary structures to support this setting. A few examples follow.\n\n### Omni-tool attacks\n\nIn v0.5.0, we removed omni-tool attacks. This is a case where I'd simply pulled the idea straight out of ME3, in which each\nclass has its own attack. Though I've received feedback that it was a fun idea, the effect was that each class's default melee\naction was set and not a choice the player can make. However, we still need to replace the ME idea of having an omni-tool attack.\nNothing feels better than picking off a few marauders at range while a group of husks close in on you and, at the last second,\nspawning a blade and cutting those zombies to shreds.\n\nI never intended to lose this feeling, but I hadn't created the structures to replace it. In v0.5.1, we're halfway there.\nWe've introduced multiple types of Omni-weapons which have the potential to work like the previous omni-tool attacks. First,\nthese weapons don't use a weapon slot (and have a weight 0 if using the Encumbrance rules). In addition, you can draw them with\na free action. So features that grant additional attacks can now be used for these omni-weapons without having to stow or draw\ndifferent weapons.\n\nCurrently there isn't a replacement for the biotic powers (Biotic Push and Punch). These should be available as cantrips\nin the next update. We're also working on providing Engineers with a cantrip-like starting power which can also replace their omni-tool power.\n\n\n### Armor Proficiency\nAnother superfluous change was tying armor proficiency to race. This somewhat came from ME1 where certain armor types were only\navailable for certain races, but it didn't add enough to the game. Mechanically, all it did was force some races to take feats in order\nto play their class effectively. It also simply added a 5,000 credit price tag for most armor. No we're back in-line with 5e\nand all armor proficiency and starting equipment is on the class.\n\n## Weapons\nAlmost all weapon weights have been reduced by 1-2.

We want to fall back on existing 5e rules and only make changes\nwhere the core rules don't have the necessary structures to support this setting. A few examples follow.</p>\n<h3>Omni-tool attacks</h3>\n<p>In v0.5.0, we removed omni-tool attacks. This is a case where I'd simply pulled the idea straight out of ME3, in which each\nclass has its own attack. Though I've received feedback that it was a fun idea, the effect was that each class's default melee\naction was set and not a choice the player can make. However, we still need to replace the ME idea of having an omni-tool attack.\nNothing feels better than picking off a few marauders at range while a group of husks close in on you and, at the last second,\nspawning a blade and cutting those zombies to shreds.</p>\n<p>I never intended to lose this feeling, but I hadn't created the structures to replace it. In v0.5.1, we're halfway there.\nWe've introduced multiple types of Omni-weapons which have the potential to work like the previous omni-tool attacks. First,\nthese weapons don't use a weapon slot (and have a weight 0 if using the Encumbrance rules). In addition, you can draw them with\na free action. So features that grant additional attacks can now be used for these omni-weapons without having to stow or draw\ndifferent weapons.</p>\n<p>Currently there isn't a replacement for the biotic powers (Biotic Push and Punch). These should be available as cantrips\nin the next update. We're also working on providing Engineers with a cantrip-like starting power which can also replace their omni-tool power.</p>\n<h3>Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Another superfluous change was tying armor proficiency to race. This somewhat came from ME1 where certain armor types were only\navailable for certain races, but it didn't add enough to the game. Mechanically, all it did was force some races to take feats in order\nto play their class effectively. It also simply added a 5,000 credit price tag for most armor. No we're back in-line with 5e\nand all armor proficiency and starting equipment is on the class.</p>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<p>Almost all weapon weights have been reduced by 1-2.

My\nanalytics were showing a pretty high bounce rate (lower is better) on the homepage, but a high acquisition rate for users that\nmanaged to make it to the Player's Manual. I.e., users would land on the site, see only news and the logo and think, \"We'll this looks\npretty lame, bye!\"\n\nWhat was initially a piecemeal approach to fixing these issues turned into a complete overhaul, which took much longer than I originally anticipated.\n\n## The Good News\n\n#### 1. Fancy new site pages\nI probably enjoy this more than most. But the homepage, about section, and news section all have new styles.\n\n#### 2. Increased interest in the system\nOver the past 2 weeks, I've received a swarm of feedback. At least 7 people have mentioned they're getting ready to start a campaign.\nThis has me floored. Before, I knew of only a few groups who were actively using the system. Not it seems like we're up to about a dozen.\nThe more users we have the more feedback and play testing we'll get, which will really help the system evolve.\n\nOn this note, I need to give some shoutouts to Ben McPherson, Noel Moriarty, Adam (TheMarmotKing), and Alex Needleman who've been working really hard on pointing out\nsite bugs, over/underpowered mechanics, and creating new content. Keep up the good work everyone!\n\n#### 3. Still get some new changes\nEven though my time was limited, I was still able to push a host of new changes, but this is mainly thanks to the aforementioned people.\n\nThe major addition is that Weapon Mods were added. These will give players a new way to get bonuses on weapons which helps alleviate the lack of\n+N magical items that 5th edition has. Another big change was the increase opportunities for classes to learn Tech and Biotic powers, which should\nhelp make the classes feel less stale between levels.\n\n## General\n* Removed \"Backgrounds\" page. Information was incomplete and not applicable. Will be re-introduced when backgrounds are complete.\n* Added basic information about resupply costs for items (Medi-gel, Heavy weapon charges, thermal clips, and grenades).\n* The opportunity to quickly reload a weapon has been labeled \"Rapid Reload,\" and is performed as a reaction to taking the Reload action.\nHowever, the Rapid Reload reaction cannot be taken by a player wielding 2 weapons.\n* Added Infrared Vision as a ersatz replacement for Truesight.\n\n## Classes\nStarting weapon choices adjusted:\n* M-8 Avenger replaces M-96 Mattock\n* M-4 Shuriken replaces M-25 Hornet\n* M-92 Mantis replaces M-13 Raptor\n* Fighting Style: amended to allow classes that learn this ability twice (soldiers, sentinels, & vanguards) to learn 2 initial perks from two different fighting styles or\none initial and one advanced perk from a single fighting style.\n* Brawler Fighting style updated. Proficiency bonus added to melee attack damage rolls. Advantage on melee attacks moved to advanced perk.\n\n### Adepts\n* Adepts learn 2 cantrips and 2 1st level spells at level 1. This makes up for the fact that Adepts do not gain any basic ability at level 1.\nI.e., Engineers = Drone; Infiltrators = Tactical Cloak, Sentinel = Tech Armor, etc.\n* Additional opportunities to learn biotic spells. Total opportunities = 16.\n\n### Engineers\n* Engineer's Efficiency added at level 3, providing the engineer with a cantrip-like tech power.\n* Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers. Total opportunities = 14\n\n### Infiltrators\n* Tech power acquisition redistributed, allowing 9 opportunities to learn or advance tech powers (used to be 6).\n* Tech point maximum increased to end at max 8, instead of max 6.\n\n### Sentinels\nOverall, Sentinels were reworked to provide more opportunities to __learn__ biotic spells and tech powers, but they can never\ncast those spells with the potency of Engineers or Adepts. This change also balances potential multi-classing. I.e., a multi-classed\nAdept/Engineer could have 8 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 10 Biotic spells (max spell slot 3rd level). Whereas a max level Sentinel\ncould have 7 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 8 Biotic Spells (max spell slot 3rd level).\n\n### Vanguards\n* Removed the automatic acquisition of Barrier at level 1. Instead, Vanguards can choose one of the following cantrips: Charge, Biotic Punch, Barrier, or Throw\n\n* Removed Sentinel Mastery class feature, replaced with additional opportunity to learn a biotic spell and tech power.\n* Increased the level at which Sentinels can learn biotic spells: 5th level = 1st level spells, 9th level = 2nd level spells, 15th level = 3rd level spells.\n* Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers and biotic spells. Total opportunities = 15\n\n## Races\n* _Krogans_ can be Engineers, this is in line with the Andromeda lore, and there is nothing relevant in the codex that would justify them\nnot being able to be Engineers.\n* _Salarians_: added High Metabolism trait indicating they need a limited amount of sleep.\n* Removed confusing syntax about taking a feat. Before, site stated that Ability Score Improvements could be substituted for a feat \"available to your race\".\nFeat acquisition is only limited during character creation for level 1 characters. Otherwise, all feats are available to all races.\n\n## Weapons\n* Added normal and long range distance to ranged weapons. Essentially, this added a limit to which weapons cannot be fired beyond.\n* Melee weapon attack damage bypasses shields.\n* Krogan Warhammer no longer stuns or pushes enemy back. Instead, has the possibility to knock the target prone.\n* M-8 Avenger: RoF reduced to 3\n* M-96 Mattock: Damage increased to d10\n* M-4 Shuriken: Damage reduced to d1\n* M-25 Hornet: Range increased to 8m\n* M-13 Raptor: Damage increased to d8\n* All Heavy Weapons are unique (cannot be modded)\n* Double Tap allows Dex mod to be used when making the attack roll (not damage roll). Used to prevent dex mod from being applied to attack and damage roll. This bring the skill in line\nwith 5th Edition's Two-Weapon Fighting rules.\n\n## Armor\n* Increase potency cost of `+1 to melee, ranged, biotic, tech, or combat` attack and damage rolls from 8000/level to 12000/level. Bring this in line\nwith weapon mods cost.\n* Potency should never be < 3\n\n## Spells\n* New cantrips: Biotic Push & Biotic Punch\n\n## Site improvements\n* Updated homepage, about page, news page, changelog\n* Spell sorting/filtering added\n* Fixed bug where Race page footer navigation had \"Next class\" as the button label\n* Fixes bug where Biotic Walls advancement, Shifting Wall, did not display complete description.\n",html:"<h2>The Bad News</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get to everything I wanted to in this release.

They've been providing a lot of great feedback and ideas\nthrough Github and it's really spurned a lot of improvements.\n\n* bpmcpherson\n* nmmoriarty\n* Duneday\n* damuttley\n* SrShadow\n* BLUEmusta\n* TheMarmotKing\n\nAdditionally,\n\n* Alex Needleman has continued to playtest and provide a lot of great feedback.\n* David Thompson has offered his help with design.\n\nThanks to everyone!!!\n\n\n## What's next?\n\nWe've got a lot of things in the works!\n\n#### Angara Race\nBen (bcmcpherson), our local Andromeda expert has been creating a lot of Andromeda content. Most notably is his [Angara concept](https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/205).\nWe're not quite ready to include everything in the system because we need to do a bit of housekeeping on the backend. But, we encourage you to test\nout the race and provide feedback!\n\n#### Digital Character Sheet\nBen has also been working on a version of the Character Sheet in Google Sheets. Once the finishing touches are ready, we'll get it up on the site.\n\n#### Loot Generator\nAs the dust settles on the cost of mods, weapons, and armor, we've been working on a Loot Generator and guidelines for awarding credits. That should be out in the very near future.\n\n\n## General\n* Added a note about race/class restrictions. Though we provide a rule of thumb, final decisions should be made by the GM.\n* Created a Combat section in the rules to reduce the length of General rules. (Some rules now exist in multiple locations, if applicable to that category).\n* Added infrared vision as a new sense.\n* Changed Rapid Reload to a bonus action and made it a variant rule.\n* Changed Thermal Clips to a standard rule. Not tracking thermal clips is a variant rule.\n\n## Classes\n* Removed Perception as skill option for Sentinels & Adepts. Added for Infiltrators & Soldiers.\n* Added additional information about spellcasting to each class page.\n* Vanguards weapon proficiency choices changed. Instead of automatically gaining shotguns, vanguards automatically gain melee and have the option of shotguns.\nVanguards are geared heavily towards a melee class and should gain that proficiency.\n* Sniper fighting style changed to +2(basic) and +4(adv) damage made with Sniper Rifles if no hostile creature is within 10m.\n\n### Adepts\n* To accommodate the changes in Lift, Biotic Control allows the Adept to lift a target 1 size larger than its current capability.\n* Barrier Ticks rescaled from 2-5\n\n### Engineers\nAs alluded to in our previous release, we've been working on an overhaul of the Drone Jockey (Engineer) subclass and it's finally here.\n\n* Drones are now a stat block in the bestiary. As such, the Drone ability will summon the bestiary version. Medics\nare still the only subclass that can access the Repair (Healing) drone.\n\n* Drone Jockeys are completely refactored. Though the multi-drone approach was fun, it significantly slowed down combat and proved slightly too powerful at all levels.\nInstead, Drone Jockeys function almost identically to 5th Edition's Ranger - Beast Conclave. You'll get to create a Drone Companion that persists outside of combat,\ngains valuable stat and defensive increases, and has its own personality.\n\n### Infiltrators\n* Moved Evasion to the 14th level\n* Removed Cunning Action at 14th level\n* New ability Fast Hands gained at 7th level\n\n### Sentinels\n* Added barrier ticks (2-6) and the ability to cast Barrier, Barrier Detonation, Lash, Phase Disruptor.\n* Sentinels can take the Protection fighting style.\n* Increased spell and tech point progression, bringing them in line with Vanguard and Infiltrator casting potency.\n\n### Soldiers\n* Sharpshooter subclass features aligned with 5th Edition's Sharpeshooter class from the [Unearthed Arcana](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2016_Fighter_UA_1205_1.pdf)\n* Gain Tactical Clip at 7th level for faster reloading\n\n#### Vanguards\n* Barrier ticks rescaled, still from 3-10, but distributed more evenly across levels\n\n## Races\nPrimarily due to work of the contributors listed above, we audited each race. We focused on missing lore specific traits,\nbalancing the traits between races, and clarifying trait mechanics. Of particular note, Asari will use Charisma as their\nspellcasting modifier for biotic spells, rather than Wisdom.\n\n### Asari\n* Cantrip replaced with Biotic Initiate, similar to 5th Edition's Magic Initiate, giving all Asari some biotic powers\n* Asari always use Charisma as their spellcasting modifier for biotic spells.\n### Geth\n* Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 STR\n### Krogan\n* Added Powerful Build\n### Quarian\n* Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 CON.\n* Hermetic suit uses exhaustion rules when breached.\n* Options for Cybernetic Augmentation improved.\n### Turian\n* Added radiant resistance.\n### Volus\n* Ability bonuses changed to reflect their race: intuitive with above-average intelligence (+2 wis, +1 int)\n* Savvy Dealings, now gives proficiency in Persuasion. The \"discounts from vendors\" was too open-ended and could pidgeon-hole Volus players making all shop transactions.\n### Vorcha\n* Added poison resistance & limb regeneration\n### Unshackled-AI.\n* Removed option of starting feat, balancing their lvl 1 options with other races.\n\n## Spells\n* __Charge__\n  * _Advanced Option Necrotic Strike_ removed. Replaced with Barrier Regen. References classic Charge/Nova Vanguard from ME3. But primarily\n* __Decoy__. Clarified the spell's mechanic\n* __Guidance__. bonus can be used on attack rolls. Limited to 1 target.\n  * _Multi Tap_. Allows application og Guidance to 3 targets (must still cast the spell for each target).\n* __Invasion__ renamed to AI Hacking. Better elicits the spell mechanic and allows for creation of Andromeda's Invasion in the future.\ngives Vanguards another option to regain barrier ticks.\n* __Lift__. removed the \"Sleep\" mechanic and changed to a ranged spell attack. Cannot benefit from being cast at higher levels. Limited to Medium target.\n  * _Advanced Option Control_, now a bonus action, reduced movement to 6m.\n  * _Advanced Option Heavy Lift_, allows you to lift a Large object or creature.\n* __Overload__\n  * _Quad Leap_ removed. Replace with increased damage options.\n* __Sentry Turret__. Sentry turret is now a stat block, casting this spell creates a turret.\n* __Tactical Scan__ duration reduced from Infinite to 10 minutes\n* __Turbocharge__ Removed. With the removal of RoF, Turbocharge was removed. We will add it back in a later version.\n\n## Bestiary\n* Added Geth Forces\n* Added Drones\n* Centurion: was missing speed, saving throws, and senses. CR was too low. Added resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, which correctly brings CR to 3.\n\n## Weapons\n\n### Weapon Balance\nIf you averaged the damage of all weapons before and after v0.7.0, you could argue that we've nerfed the weapons. But\nwe consider this version to bring a much better balance to the weapon system, despite the slightly reduced damage overall.\n\nWe noticed quite a few problems with the previous versions\n1. Weapons dealt 15-20% more damage than in 5th Edition\n2. The spread of damage was huge 1d4 => 4d10\n3. The Rate of Fire mechanic didn't have any benefits other than being flavor about the weapon. And even the flavor was difficult to apply.\nTake the M-4 Shuriken: in the game, this weapon specifically has a six-round burst, meaning 6 RoF. But since it's meant to be a starting weapon, we had to make it deal 6d1. There are other cases where RoF didn't directly correlate.\n4. Weapon damage was unbalanced. We received a lot of feedback that Shotguns were too powerful, Sniper rifles underpowered, and melee weapons worthless.\n\nOur solution was to create weapon profiles and build from those profiles. In doing so we also created distinct levels for\nthe weapons that mirror 5th edition's item rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare). This provided a system in which we could\nmake objectively better weapons, whereas previous versions attempted to make all weapons unique (save for the starting weapons).\n\nWe're very pleased with the result and feel the weapons are more balanced than they've ever been. If you'd like to read the entire\ndiscussion, please refer to the [github issue](https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/249). Additionally, we prepared\n[an analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSq70x_GZuDKcELgX8k_7Hd6nLGu3DoIEdDwP-YEGjUU-ghGc7ot_Q7140FZwGbEalHgzPwVm4BN8y_/pubhtml?gid=332103674&single=true) of the new weapon balance.\n\n### Changes\n* Weapons now have a 4-tier rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare.\n* Weapon costs have been adjusted to reflect rarities: Common >= 3,000, Uncommon >= 10,000, Rare >= 30,000, Very Rare >= 50,000\n* Rate of Fire (RoF) has been removed. While we liked the flavor it added, it didn't have any other benefit. Plus, it was difficult to keep the flavor consistent among weapons.\n\n#### Assault Rifles\n* Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle: 4d6 => 2d6, deals and additional 1d6 damage to synthetic targets.\n* Cerberus Harrier: 4d4 => 2d6\n* Geth Pulse Rifle: 6d4 => 2d6, deals radiant damage\n* M-15 Vindicator: 3d4 => 1d10\n* M-55 Argus: 3d6 => 1d12\n* M-7 Lancer: 4d6 => 2d6\n* M-76 Revenant: 5d4 => 3d4\n* M-8 Avenger: 3d4 => 1d8\n* M-96 Mattock: 1d10 => 1d8\n* M-99 Saber: 1d10 => 3d6, customization options changes\n* N7 Typhoon: 5d4 => 2d8\n* N7 Valkyrie: 2d6 => 2d8\n* Particle Rifle: 6d4 => 2d10\n* Phaeston: 4d4 => 2d4\n* Striker Assault Rifle: 4d6 => 1d12, special updated, can start targeting to deal additional damage\n\n#### Heavy Pistols\n* Acolyte: 1d8 => 1d6\n* Arc Pistol: 1d8 => 1d6\n* Executioner Pistol: 1d12 => 2d12\n* M-358 Talon: 2d8 => 2d6\n* N7 Eagle: 4d4 => 2d4\n* Scorpion: 1d8 => 1d6\n\n#### Melee\n* Asari Huntress Sword: 1d6 => 1d8\n* Krogan Warhammer: 1d12 => 2d6 (1d12 as a one-handed weapon)\n* Monomolecular blade: 1d8 => 1d10\n* Omni-blade: 1d6 => 1d8\n* Omni-hammer: 1d8 => 1d10\n* Omni-whip: 1d8 => 2d4\n\n#### Shotguns\n* AT-12 Raider: 2d10 => 2d8\n* Disciple: 2d6 => 2d4\n* Geth Plasma Shotgun: 2d12 => 2d10\n* Graal Spike Thrower: 2d12 => 2d6.

Removed +2 on ranged attack rolls, added \"Can reload as a bonus action\"\n\n### Weapon Mods\nIn the last release, we introduced weapon mods, but this was rushed and not thoroughly tested. It became clear that the stacking of certain mods\n(especially between weapons an armor) created very high bonuses. In 5th edition, +X items are limited to +4 for legendary type items, but our\nmod combinations could result in as much as +7. In response, we've changed or removed any armor mods or sets that increased the effectiveness of\nranged weapons. Basically, let weapon mods buff weapons and let armor mods buff defenses. The only caveat is that armor can still provide boosts\nto melee weapons, as they currently have no mods.\n\n* Rename \"core\" type to \"ammo\"\n* Cranial Trauma Mod: Limit to one level (1 additional damage die on critical hit)\n* Power magnifier: Limit to one level (currently lvl 3 has potential to add +9 with some subclasses).\n* Concentration Mod: Limit to one level (19-20 crit)\n* Piercing Mod: Rename piercing ammo.

They've been providing a lot of great feedback and ideas\nthrough Github and it's really spurned a lot of improvements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bpmcpherson</li>\n<li>nmmoriarty</li>\n<li>Duneday</li>\n<li>damuttley</li>\n<li>SrShadow</li>\n<li>BLUEmusta</li>\n<li>TheMarmotKing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex Needleman has continued to playtest and provide a lot of great feedback.</li>\n<li>David Thompson has offered his help with design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to everyone!!!</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>We've got a lot of things in the works!</p>\n<h4>Angara Race</h4>\n<p>Ben (bcmcpherson), our local Andromeda expert has been creating a lot of Andromeda content. Most notably is his <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/205\">Angara concept</a>.\nWe're not quite ready to include everything in the system because we need to do a bit of housekeeping on the backend. But, we encourage you to test\nout the race and provide feedback!</p>\n<h4>Digital Character Sheet</h4>\n<p>Ben has also been working on a version of the Character Sheet in Google Sheets. Once the finishing touches are ready, we'll get it up on the site.</p>\n<h4>Loot Generator</h4>\n<p>As the dust settles on the cost of mods, weapons, and armor, we've been working on a Loot Generator and guidelines for awarding credits. That should be out in the very near future.</p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a note about race/class restrictions. Though we provide a rule of thumb, final decisions should be made by the GM.</li>\n<li>Created a Combat section in the rules to reduce the length of General rules. (Some rules now exist in multiple locations, if applicable to that category).</li>\n<li>Added infrared vision as a new sense.</li>\n<li>Changed Rapid Reload to a bonus action and made it a variant rule.</li>\n<li>Changed Thermal Clips to a standard rule. Not tracking thermal clips is a variant rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed Perception as skill option for Sentinels &amp; Adepts. Added for Infiltrators &amp; Soldiers.</li>\n<li>Added additional information about spellcasting to each class page.</li>\n<li>Vanguards weapon proficiency choices changed. Instead of automatically gaining shotguns, vanguards automatically gain melee and have the option of shotguns.\nVanguards are geared heavily towards a melee class and should gain that proficiency.</li>\n<li>Sniper fighting style changed to +2(basic) and +4(adv) damage made with Sniper Rifles if no hostile creature is within 10m.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To accommodate the changes in Lift, Biotic Control allows the Adept to lift a target 1 size larger than its current capability.</li>\n<li>Barrier Ticks rescaled from 2-5</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Engineers</h3>\n<p>As alluded to in our previous release, we've been working on an overhaul of the Drone Jockey (Engineer) subclass and it's finally here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Drones are now a stat block in the bestiary. As such, the Drone ability will summon the bestiary version. Medics\nare still the only subclass that can access the Repair (Healing) drone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drone Jockeys are completely refactored. Though the multi-drone approach was fun, it significantly slowed down combat and proved slightly too powerful at all levels.\nInstead, Drone Jockeys function almost identically to 5th Edition's Ranger - Beast Conclave. You'll get to create a Drone Companion that persists outside of combat,\ngains valuable stat and defensive increases, and has its own personality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved Evasion to the 14th level</li>\n<li>Removed Cunning Action at 14th level</li>\n<li>New ability Fast Hands gained at 7th level</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentinels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added barrier ticks (2-6) and the ability to cast Barrier, Barrier Detonation, Lash, Phase Disruptor.</li>\n<li>Sentinels can take the Protection fighting style.</li>\n<li>Increased spell and tech point progression, bringing them in line with Vanguard and Infiltrator casting potency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Soldiers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharpshooter subclass features aligned with 5th Edition's Sharpeshooter class from the <a href=\"https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2016_Fighter_UA_1205_1.pdf\">Unearthed Arcana</a></li>\n<li>Gain Tactical Clip at 7th level for faster reloading</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Vanguards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier ticks rescaled, still from 3-10, but distributed more evenly across levels</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<p>Primarily due to work of the contributors listed above, we audited each race. We focused on missing lore specific traits,\nbalancing the traits between races, and clarifying trait mechanics. Of particular note, Asari will use Charisma as their\nspellcasting modifier for biotic spells, rather than Wisdom.</p>\n<h3>Asari</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrip replaced with Biotic Initiate, similar to 5th Edition's Magic Initiate, giving all Asari some biotic powers</li>\n<li>Asari always use Charisma as their spellcasting modifier for biotic spells.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Geth</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 STR</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Krogan</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Powerful Build</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quarian</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to +2 INT, +1 CON.</li>\n<li>Hermetic suit uses exhaustion rules when breached.</li>\n<li>Options for Cybernetic Augmentation improved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Turian</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added radiant resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Volus</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability bonuses changed to reflect their race: intuitive with above-average intelligence (+2 wis, +1 int)</li>\n<li>Savvy Dealings, now gives proficiency in Persuasion. The &quot;discounts from vendors&quot; was too open-ended and could pidgeon-hole Volus players making all shop transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vorcha</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added poison resistance &amp; limb regeneration</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unshackled-AI.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed option of starting feat, balancing their lvl 1 options with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Charge</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Necrotic Strike</em> removed. Replaced with Barrier Regen. References classic Charge/Nova Vanguard from ME3. But primarily</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decoy</strong>. Clarified the spell's mechanic</li>\n<li><strong>Guidance</strong>. bonus can be used on attack rolls. Limited to 1 target.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Multi Tap</em>. Allows application og Guidance to 3 targets (must still cast the spell for each target).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Invasion</strong> renamed to AI Hacking. Better elicits the spell mechanic and allows for creation of Andromeda's Invasion in the future.\ngives Vanguards another option to regain barrier ticks.</li>\n<li><strong>Lift</strong>. removed the &quot;Sleep&quot; mechanic and changed to a ranged spell attack. Cannot benefit from being cast at higher levels. Limited to Medium target.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Control</em>, now a bonus action, reduced movement to 6m.</li>\n<li><em>Advanced Option Heavy Lift</em>, allows you to lift a Large object or creature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Overload</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quad Leap</em> removed. Replace with increased damage options.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong>. Sentry turret is now a stat block, casting this spell creates a turret.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactical Scan</strong> duration reduced from Infinite to 10 minutes</li>\n<li><strong>Turbocharge</strong> Removed. With the removal of RoF, Turbocharge was removed. We will add it back in a later version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Geth Forces</li>\n<li>Added Drones</li>\n<li>Centurion: was missing speed, saving throws, and senses. CR was too low. Added resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, which correctly brings CR to 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<h3>Weapon Balance</h3>\n<p>If you averaged the damage of all weapons before and after v0.7.0, you could argue that we've nerfed the weapons. But\nwe consider this version to bring a much better balance to the weapon system, despite the slightly reduced damage overall.</p>\n<p>We noticed quite a few problems with the previous versions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Weapons dealt 15-20% more damage than in 5th Edition</li>\n<li>The spread of damage was huge 1d4 =&gt; 4d10</li>\n<li>The Rate of Fire mechanic didn't have any benefits other than being flavor about the weapon. And even the flavor was difficult to apply.\nTake the M-4 Shuriken: in the game, this weapon specifically has a six-round burst, meaning 6 RoF. But since it's meant to be a starting weapon, we had to make it deal 6d1. There are other cases where RoF didn't directly correlate.</li>\n<li>Weapon damage was unbalanced. We received a lot of feedback that Shotguns were too powerful, Sniper rifles underpowered, and melee weapons worthless.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our solution was to create weapon profiles and build from those profiles. In doing so we also created distinct levels for\nthe weapons that mirror 5th edition's item rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare). This provided a system in which we could\nmake objectively better weapons, whereas previous versions attempted to make all weapons unique (save for the starting weapons).</p>\n<p>We're very pleased with the result and feel the weapons are more balanced than they've ever been. If you'd like to read the entire\ndiscussion, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/249\">github issue</a>. Additionally, we prepared\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSq70x_GZuDKcELgX8k_7Hd6nLGu3DoIEdDwP-YEGjUU-ghGc7ot_Q7140FZwGbEalHgzPwVm4BN8y_/pubhtml?gid=332103674&amp;single=true\">an analysis</a> of the new weapon balance.</p>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Weapons now have a 4-tier rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare.</li>\n<li>Weapon costs have been adjusted to reflect rarities: Common &gt;= 3,000, Uncommon &gt;= 10,000, Rare &gt;= 30,000, Very Rare &gt;= 50,000</li>\n<li>Rate of Fire (RoF) has been removed. While we liked the flavor it added, it didn't have any other benefit. Plus, it was difficult to keep the flavor consistent among weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Assault Rifles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adas Anti-Synthetic Rifle: 4d6 =&gt; 2d6, deals and additional 1d6 damage to synthetic targets.</li>\n<li>Cerberus Harrier: 4d4 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>Geth Pulse Rifle: 6d4 =&gt; 2d6, deals radiant damage</li>\n<li>M-15 Vindicator: 3d4 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>M-55 Argus: 3d6 =&gt; 1d12</li>\n<li>M-7 Lancer: 4d6 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>M-76 Revenant: 5d4 =&gt; 3d4</li>\n<li>M-8 Avenger: 3d4 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>M-96 Mattock: 1d10 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>M-99 Saber: 1d10 =&gt; 3d6, customization options changes</li>\n<li>N7 Typhoon: 5d4 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>N7 Valkyrie: 2d6 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>Particle Rifle: 6d4 =&gt; 2d10</li>\n<li>Phaeston: 4d4 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Striker Assault Rifle: 4d6 =&gt; 1d12, special updated, can start targeting to deal additional damage</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Heavy Pistols</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Acolyte: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n<li>Arc Pistol: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n<li>Executioner Pistol: 1d12 =&gt; 2d12</li>\n<li>M-358 Talon: 2d8 =&gt; 2d6</li>\n<li>N7 Eagle: 4d4 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Scorpion: 1d8 =&gt; 1d6</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Melee</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Asari Huntress Sword: 1d6 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>Krogan Warhammer: 1d12 =&gt; 2d6 (1d12 as a one-handed weapon)</li>\n<li>Monomolecular blade: 1d8 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>Omni-blade: 1d6 =&gt; 1d8</li>\n<li>Omni-hammer: 1d8 =&gt; 1d10</li>\n<li>Omni-whip: 1d8 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shotguns</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AT-12 Raider: 2d10 =&gt; 2d8</li>\n<li>Disciple: 2d6 =&gt; 2d4</li>\n<li>Geth Plasma Shotgun: 2d12 =&gt; 2d10</li>\n<li>Graal Spike Thrower: 2d12 =&gt; 2d6.

Prior, there was an AC penalty if you were not wearing armor, resulting in very low AC and\nmaking it very dangerous to play a character without armor. Now, AC is granted by individual armor pieces.\n\n### Backgrounds, Tools & Tool Proficiencies, and Omni-Gel\nThis homebrew is a work in progress. Instead of spending years behind closed doors and delivering\na prefect product, our philosophy is to publish content quickly so players can test it and then we refine later. So before you\nget too excited about backgrounds, note that this is the first draft. The same goes for the tool proficiencies. As you'll\nquickly realize, some backgrounds reference Starship System proficiencies. These proficiencies are currently\nstubs and have no in-game mechanics. We're working on a larger starship rule set, which we'll release in v0.9.0.\n\nOmni-gel is a new resource that is necessary to power tool kit abilities.\n\nAs this is brand new content, we would love to hear your [feedback and ideas](/contributing).\n\n### Burst Fire\nWe've introduced a new weapon feature that borrows from the Dungeon Master's Guide, _Burst Fire_. Weapons with Burst Fire allow players to spend their action\n\"spraying and praying\" giving a bit more variety to assault rifles and smgs.\n\n### Fighting styles\nThe advanced versions of fighting styles have been removed. Trying to balance advanced fighting styles proved difficult,\nand many advanced versions we're too powerful. In addition, some fighting styles have been updated:\n* Gunslinger: Effectively grants Two-Weapon fighting for ranged weapons. Though it can no longer stack with Double Tap, there is no damage penalty on the attack\nmade with your bonus action.\n* The Freehand: Description clarified to provide bonus when wielding a weapon that is not two-handed\n* Carnage: Replaced with damage reroll (similar to 5th Edition's Great Weapon Fighter).\n* _(New)_ Close Quarters Shooter: Slightly less powerful version of 5th editions, the limitations are put in place because the majority of combat is ranged and the\nbenefit of the 5th edition version out-shined all other offensive fighting styles\n* _(New)_ Assault: Increases your Burst Fire capability\n\n### Barrier\nBarrier has proved to be a difficult ability to figure out. One of the primary problems is that barrier has changed between\nevery game. Here are the iterations:\n\n* Mass Effect 1: Active boost in shields points, specifically providing an additional layer of shields for a duration\n* Mass Effect 2: Active boost to overall damage reduction\n* Mass Effect 3:Vanguards and Adepts had a 'biotic barrier' instead of shields which powered some biotic abilities.\nThere was also a power called Barrier that worked like ME2, but had a new barrier detonation component.\n* Mass Effect: Andromeda: Passive bonuses to shields\n\nSince the onset of the project, we've wanted to keep unique and iconic powers, one of which was the Nova Vanguard which\ngrew in popularity in Mass Effect 3. So we created a system that could improve spells by using a resource _other than_ spell slots.\nBut this has added a dimension of spell complexity not found in 5th edition. The other problem was barrier ticks, a class\nresource that could only be regenerated with a cantrip. This ultimated made the cantrip mandatory. Therefore, we've made Barrier\na class feature available to Adepts, Sentinels, and Vanguards.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the changes:\n* \"_Nerfs_\"\n  * Scaling damage reduction removed, instead classes gain increased damage reduction at specific levels.\n  * Barrier has a limited number of casts based on your class level\n* \"_Buffs_\"\n  * Barrier can be cast as an action or bonus action\n  * Having an active barrier does not reduce speed\n\nWe hope that this makes barrier less confusing without completely overhauling the system.\n\n### Cantrips\nInstead of learning cantrips as part of your spell gains, you instead learn cantrips as you progress in your class level.\nIn short, you know a number of cantrips (advanced count as 2 cantrips) based on the number of cantrips known on your progression table.\n\n### Detonators\nThe potency of detonators have been increased slightly, giving them a more satisfying feel. We will continue to work on how to make these more attractive.\n\n## Races\nAll races have been provided with a flat 10,000 credit increase to their starting credits. Prior to the increase, average rolls were comparable to taking the starting equipment,\nproviding almost no benefit for gambling.\n\n### Salarians\n* Photographic memory: Proficiency bonus is based only on ability checks for recalling information.\n\n## Classes\n\n### Adepts\n* __Blackstar__: Biotic Control, Lift and Pull names are swapped (see spells below). Additionally, the Lift portion provides advantage when maintaining the spell.\n\n### Infiltrator\n* Tactical cloak: Added a duration of 1 minute\n\n### Sentinels\n* Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style\n* __Bastion__: _Assault Armor_, clarified the wording of this feature. Added additional saving throws for affected targets.\n\n### Vanguards\n* Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style\n* __Shock Trooper__: Biotic Slash now detonates a primed target.\n\n\n## Spells\nOur Barrier changes came about from a spell review. We've slowly working through all of our spells, testing, theory-crafting, and\ndiscussing changes. This process should help clarify spell text and make advanced options more attractive. We've finished cantrips\nand will be working through the other biotic spell levels, tech, and combat in future partial releases.\n\n* __Backlash__: Change to a concentration spell, lasts 1 minute\n* __Charge__\n  * _Distance_: Removed. Was not as attractive as Barrier Regen\n  * _Stunning Blow (new)_: Stuns target that fails saving throw. Provides a control option for players not investing in Barrier.\n* __Biotic Push__: Removed. Between Throw and Biotic Punch, there was no niche that Biotic Push filled.\n* __Biotic Pumch__: Flat barrier tick gain. Casting time is an Action.\n  * _Siphoning Strike_: Gain 10 shield points.\n* __Dark Channel__: Damage reduced to d6. Dark Channel caused equivalent damage to 1st level spells. Instead of transferring to a _random_ creature,\ntransfers to the _nearest_ creature.\n* __Dark Sphere__: Reduced duration to 1 minute.\n* __Lash__: Removed barrier tick cost. Set range of 10m.\n* __Lift__: Has been renamed _Pull_, as the mechanics of this spell better reflect _Pull_ in Mass Effect 2, 3, and Andromeda\n* __Pull__: Has been renamed _Lift_ and refactored, becoming a cantrip for moving objects around with a mass effect field.\n* __Sabotage__: Removed the attack roll, but increased cost. Added saving throw for weapons that are a part of creatures.\n  * _Backfire_: Replaces Disable. Deals damage back at attacker.\n* __Sentry Turret__: Added duration of 1 minute.\n* __Slam__: Clarified that this spell can be used on a creature.\n  * _Reaction_: Replaces Improved Damage. Allows Slam to be cast as a reaction.\n* __Slow Fall__: Added advanced options\n  * _Improved Duration_: 5 min duration\n  * _Navigate_: Can direct the movement of the fall.\n* __Submission Net__: Refactored, the spell text was confusing. Now the focus is controlling targets and preventing Tech casting.\n  * _Electrified Net_: Allows dealing damage to trapped targets\n  * _Anti-Tech_: Can cast as a reaction when creature casts tech\n* __Throw__: Increased damage to d8. Added Medium or smaller restriction to push back.\n  * _Radial Blast_: Replaces Improved Force. Deals damage to all creatures within 2m sphere of initial target.\n\n## Weapons\n* Added ML-77 Missile Launcher\n* Added Collector Sniper Rifle\n\n\n## Bestiary\nAs the bestiary has grew a problem became terribly evident: there were too many low-CR monsters. If you want numbers, ~90%\nof the bestiary was found between CRs 1/8 and 3. This presents a primary problem for high-level characters because there\nwas a severe lack of content for them to run. So the bestiary \"bump\" is our redistribution of CRs, increasing the CRs of\nmost monsters. Monsters that have had CR increases have had their stat blocks updated to reflect those changes.\n\nThe benefit of this change is distributing monsters throughout CR levels, which allows more opportunities boss battles\nand improves experience gain. As with most games, killing numerous low-level npcs is never as productive as killing a single\nhigh-level npc. This redistribution gives players across all levels more high-level monsters to fight.\n\nHowever, some will find issue that this feels like an overall \"nerf\" to their characters. I.e., in previous versions\na level 1 character could easily take out a variety of forces Cerberus & Geth Troopers, Husks, etc. The new version\nincreases the difficultly of these \"starting\" monsters. We understand this is a drastic difference from the game and that\nlevel 1 characters will not feel as powerful. We would like to offer the following reconceptualization of level 1 characters:\n\nIn the games, you play as Shepard, who is a highly-skilled, well-trained solder. You captain a ship and have achieved some\nof the highest ranks in the military. Thus, we see Shepard as a level 12-15 character and his/her ability to easily\nmow down opponents is due to their higher level. As a level 1 character, your still green. You may have some experience\nbut its not enough to easily down a whole platoon of cerberus troopers.\n\n__New__:\n* Elcor\n* Harvester\n* Klixen\n* Pyjak\n* Thresher Maw\n* Varren\n* Varren Alpha\n* Yahg\n",html:"<h2>General</h2>\n<h3>AC</h3>\n<p>The way AC is calculated has been changed.

Instead of spending years behind closed doors and delivering\na prefect product, our philosophy is to publish content quickly so players can test it and then we refine later. So before you\nget too excited about backgrounds, note that this is the first draft. The same goes for the tool proficiencies. As you'll\nquickly realize, some backgrounds reference Starship System proficiencies. These proficiencies are currently\nstubs and have no in-game mechanics. We're working on a larger starship rule set, which we'll release in v0.9.0.</p>\n<p>Omni-gel is a new resource that is necessary to power tool kit abilities.</p>\n<p>As this is brand new content, we would love to hear your <a href=\"/contributing\">feedback and ideas</a>.</p>\n<h3>Burst Fire</h3>\n<p>We've introduced a new weapon feature that borrows from the Dungeon Master's Guide, <em>Burst Fire</em>. Weapons with Burst Fire allow players to spend their action\n&quot;spraying and praying&quot; giving a bit more variety to assault rifles and smgs.</p>\n<h3>Fighting styles</h3>\n<p>The advanced versions of fighting styles have been removed. Trying to balance advanced fighting styles proved difficult,\nand many advanced versions we're too powerful. In addition, some fighting styles have been updated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gunslinger: Effectively grants Two-Weapon fighting for ranged weapons. Though it can no longer stack with Double Tap, there is no damage penalty on the attack\nmade with your bonus action.</li>\n<li>The Freehand: Description clarified to provide bonus when wielding a weapon that is not two-handed</li>\n<li>Carnage: Replaced with damage reroll (similar to 5th Edition's Great Weapon Fighter).</li>\n<li><em>(New)</em> Close Quarters Shooter: Slightly less powerful version of 5th editions, the limitations are put in place because the majority of combat is ranged and the\nbenefit of the 5th edition version out-shined all other offensive fighting styles</li>\n<li><em>(New)</em> Assault: Increases your Burst Fire capability</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Barrier</h3>\n<p>Barrier has proved to be a difficult ability to figure out. One of the primary problems is that barrier has changed between\nevery game. Here are the iterations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mass Effect 1: Active boost in shields points, specifically providing an additional layer of shields for a duration</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 2: Active boost to overall damage reduction</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 3:Vanguards and Adepts had a 'biotic barrier' instead of shields which powered some biotic abilities.\nThere was also a power called Barrier that worked like ME2, but had a new barrier detonation component.</li>\n<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda: Passive bonuses to shields</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the onset of the project, we've wanted to keep unique and iconic powers, one of which was the Nova Vanguard which\ngrew in popularity in Mass Effect 3. So we created a system that could improve spells by using a resource <em>other than</em> spell slots.\nBut this has added a dimension of spell complexity not found in 5th edition. The other problem was barrier ticks, a class\nresource that could only be regenerated with a cantrip. This ultimated made the cantrip mandatory. Therefore, we've made Barrier\na class feature available to Adepts, Sentinels, and Vanguards.</p>\n<p>Here is the breakdown of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em>Nerfs</em>&quot;\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling damage reduction removed, instead classes gain increased damage reduction at specific levels.</li>\n<li>Barrier has a limited number of casts based on your class level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>&quot;<em>Buffs</em>&quot;\n<ul>\n<li>Barrier can be cast as an action or bonus action</li>\n<li>Having an active barrier does not reduce speed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope that this makes barrier less confusing without completely overhauling the system.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Instead of learning cantrips as part of your spell gains, you instead learn cantrips as you progress in your class level.\nIn short, you know a number of cantrips (advanced count as 2 cantrips) based on the number of cantrips known on your progression table.</p>\n<h3>Detonators</h3>\n<p>The potency of detonators have been increased slightly, giving them a more satisfying feel. We will continue to work on how to make these more attractive.</p>\n<h2>Races</h2>\n<p>All races have been provided with a flat 10,000 credit increase to their starting credits. Prior to the increase, average rolls were comparable to taking the starting equipment,\nproviding almost no benefit for gambling.</p>\n<h3>Salarians</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Photographic memory: Proficiency bonus is based only on ability checks for recalling information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Classes</h2>\n<h3>Adepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blackstar</strong>: Biotic Control, Lift and Pull names are swapped (see spells below). Additionally, the Lift portion provides advantage when maintaining the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infiltrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tactical cloak: Added a duration of 1 minute</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sentinels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style</li>\n<li><strong>Bastion</strong>: <em>Assault Armor</em>, clarified the wording of this feature. Added additional saving throws for affected targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vanguards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the attainment of an advanced Fighting Style</li>\n<li><strong>Shock Trooper</strong>: Biotic Slash now detonates a primed target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Our Barrier changes came about from a spell review. We've slowly working through all of our spells, testing, theory-crafting, and\ndiscussing changes. This process should help clarify spell text and make advanced options more attractive. We've finished cantrips\nand will be working through the other biotic spell levels, tech, and combat in future partial releases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backlash</strong>: Change to a concentration spell, lasts 1 minute</li>\n<li><strong>Charge</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Distance</em>: Removed. Was not as attractive as Barrier Regen</li>\n<li><em>Stunning Blow (new)</em>: Stuns target that fails saving throw. Provides a control option for players not investing in Barrier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Biotic Push</strong>: Removed. Between Throw and Biotic Punch, there was no niche that Biotic Push filled.</li>\n<li><strong>Biotic Pumch</strong>: Flat barrier tick gain. Casting time is an Action.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Siphoning Strike</em>: Gain 10 shield points.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Dark Channel</strong>: Damage reduced to d6. Dark Channel caused equivalent damage to 1st level spells. Instead of transferring to a <em>random</em> creature,\ntransfers to the <em>nearest</em> creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Dark Sphere</strong>: Reduced duration to 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Lash</strong>: Removed barrier tick cost. Set range of 10m.</li>\n<li><strong>Lift</strong>: Has been renamed <em>Pull</em>, as the mechanics of this spell better reflect <em>Pull</em> in Mass Effect 2, 3, and Andromeda</li>\n<li><strong>Pull</strong>: Has been renamed <em>Lift</em> and refactored, becoming a cantrip for moving objects around with a mass effect field.</li>\n<li><strong>Sabotage</strong>: Removed the attack roll, but increased cost. Added saving throw for weapons that are a part of creatures.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Backfire</em>: Replaces Disable. Deals damage back at attacker.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong>: Added duration of 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Slam</strong>: Clarified that this spell can be used on a creature.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Reaction</em>: Replaces Improved Damage. Allows Slam to be cast as a reaction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Slow Fall</strong>: Added advanced options\n<ul>\n<li><em>Improved Duration</em>: 5 min duration</li>\n<li><em>Navigate</em>: Can direct the movement of the fall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Submission Net</strong>: Refactored, the spell text was confusing. Now the focus is controlling targets and preventing Tech casting.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Electrified Net</em>: Allows dealing damage to trapped targets</li>\n<li><em>Anti-Tech</em>: Can cast as a reaction when creature casts tech</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Throw</strong>: Increased damage to d8. Added Medium or smaller restriction to push back.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Radial Blast</em>: Replaces Improved Force. Deals damage to all creatures within 2m sphere of initial target.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ML-77 Missile Launcher</li>\n<li>Added Collector Sniper Rifle</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<p>As the bestiary has grew a problem became terribly evident: there were too many low-CR monsters. If you want numbers, ~90%\nof the bestiary was found between CRs 1/8 and 3. This presents a primary problem for high-level characters because there\nwas a severe lack of content for them to run. So the bestiary &quot;bump&quot; is our redistribution of CRs, increasing the CRs of\nmost monsters. Monsters that have had CR increases have had their stat blocks updated to reflect those changes.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this change is distributing monsters throughout CR levels, which allows more opportunities boss battles\nand improves experience gain. As with most games, killing numerous low-level npcs is never as productive as killing a single\nhigh-level npc. This redistribution gives players across all levels more high-level monsters to fight.</p>\n<p>However, some will find issue that this feels like an overall &quot;nerf&quot; to their characters. I.e., in previous versions\na level 1 character could easily take out a variety of forces Cerberus &amp; Geth Troopers, Husks, etc. The new version\nincreases the difficultly of these &quot;starting&quot; monsters. We understand this is a drastic difference from the game and that\nlevel 1 characters will not feel as powerful. We would like to offer the following reconceptualization of level 1 characters:</p>\n<p>In the games, you play as Shepard, who is a highly-skilled, well-trained solder. You captain a ship and have achieved some\nof the highest ranks in the military. Thus, we see Shepard as a level 12-15 character and his/her ability to easily\nmow down opponents is due to their higher level. As a level 1 character, your still green. You may have some experience\nbut its not enough to easily down a whole platoon of cerberus troopers.</p>\n<p><strong>New</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elcor</li>\n<li>Harvester</li>\n<li>Klixen</li>\n<li>Pyjak</li>\n<li>Thresher Maw</li>\n<li>Varren</li>\n<li>Varren Alpha</li>\n<li>Yahg</li>\n</ul>\n",attributes:{layout:"post",title:"v0.8.0",description:"Backgrounds, Bestiary Bump, and Barrier",date:"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z",image:"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/6/60/Kasumi_Briefing.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/800?cb=20100617000152"},vue:{render:"return function render() { var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0) }",staticRenderFns:'return [function () { var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c(\'div\',{staticClass:"frontmatter-markdown"},[_c(\'h2\',[_vm._v("General")]),_vm._v(" "),_c(\'h3\',[_vm._v("AC")]),_vm._v(" "),_c(\'p\',[_vm._v("The way AC is calculated has been changed.

Special thanks to TheMarmotKing for taking\nthe lead on this. We feel the spells are much more balanced and fun.\n\n__Annihilation Field__\n* Reduced range to 4m\n* I've been wanting to get rid of the -1AC advanced options for a while. The originally represented reduced armor. In Mass\nEffect, that's great, because it effects enemies with \"Armor\" (i.e., a yellow health bar). But the translation gets muddled when\nmapped onto Armor Class, which is a concept not a physical thing. _Disorient_ isn't that original, but giving anything\ndisadvantage is pretty useful.\n\n__Backlash__\n* Added the note that this applies to the triggering attack.\n* Changed the wording to allow this to block damage from ranged spell attacks (not just weapon attacks)\n* Added note that reflecting damage cannot be triggered by a heavy weapon (they're technically ranged attacks)\n* Reduced the higher level hp increase to 10 instead of 20. At +20 hp, a 5th level cast was 75 additional hp...seemed a\nbit much. This also brings the spell in line with 5th's Armor of Agathys.\n* In the same vein, removed the additional hp at higher level casts from Durable advancement. Total hp gain on durable\nis now 60 instead of 75.\n* Clarified the issue with remaining damage and reflecting damage back at the attacker with \"If damage that would be dealt\nto the aegis...\". RAW would be: Aegis has 1HP remaining. Player is hit with a ranged weapon attack for 10 damage. First,\nsplit the damage (5 and 5). 5 is dealt back at the attack. 1 is dealt to the aegis. 4 is dealt to the player.\n\n__Biotic Orbs__\n* Now a concentration spell, limiting potential spamming of higher level casts and prevents spell from stacking\n* Casting a spell costs orbs, clearing up the casting mechanic\n* Added action cost to the ranged attack\n* Defensive orbs was underpowered compared to improved orbs. Retribution has more potential and works as a panic button\nto get use out of the orbs if the player's concentration fails\n\n__Biotic Sphere__\n* Keeps out all hostile creatures, consequently removes the advantage on creatures within it.\n* Increased hit points\n* Clarifies how the damage and attacks are delegated. Essentially, when you're in the barrier, you can't be hit. The barrier takes all the damage.\n* Because this represents an increase in the spells power, and the fact that biotic wall is also a 3rd level spell, this spell was made 4th level\n* _Infuse ammo_ doesn't reduce the sphere's hp and increased the damage to 1d6\n* _Armored_ gained resistance to thunder damage. 100 hp with resistance to the most standard damage types seemed a bit much, so reduced the starting hp to 75\n\n__Biotic Wall__\n* using cm instead of inches (for consistency)\n* _Shifting wall_ is a bonus action, not reaction because there was nothing to trigger the reacgion\n\n__Dark Sphere__\n* Now the sphere moves at the end of your turn and detonates at the start of your turn if its traveled 20m. This prevents\nthe possibility of the sphere moving at the start of your turn AND detonating.\n* Instead of the sphere's explosion causing another primed effect, it now detonates targets.\n* _Control_ has the option to increase the speed (getting it to 20m in as little as 3 rounds)\n\n__Dominate__\n* 3rd level spell\n* Adjusted to work similarly to it's 5th edition counterpart\n* Upped psychic damage to make it more attractive\n\n__Flare__\n* Increased range.\n\n__Fly__\n* There was an error that showed an old version of Lift for this spell. Fly now works similarly to 5th edition's fly spell\n\n__Lash__\n* Lash used to cost barrier ticks and automatically hit. The barrier tick cost was removed, but not the auto-hit, making\nthis spell too powerful. The auto-hit has been replaced with a ranged spell attack.\n\n__Singularity__\n* Str save, no dex saves\n* _Necrotic field_ replaces _Damage_. It buffs the damage and happens every turn to any creature in the field (despite\nif they're affected by the spell or not). Additionally, they're also primed (necrotic) which would set off 2 detonations\nif the target is also lifted. Necrotic field is a great advancement for people who want to set up combos but don't care\nmuch about the control aspect.\n\n__Stasis__\n* Increased the range, reduced the duration\n* Targets in stasis have damage resistance as they did in the Mass Effect games\n* Vulnerable advancement option didn't make sense because of the damage resistance, this was changed to shatter,\nwhich builds up damage over time.\n\n__Storm__\n* Added half damage on successful save\n\n__Warp__\n* Increased range.\n* Clarified what it meant to stabilize a creature. In 5th, you can only stabilize an unconscious creature, so this simply states what needs to be done.\n* Removed the \"knocked prone\" portion of \"Keel Over\" as this inhibits ranged attacks. Because of this, it needed to be renamed, Disorient.\n\n__Vortex__\n* Damage was lacking. 3rd level AoE spell should be about 31-36 damage. Bumped to 6d10 for 33 dmg.\n* Updated _radial_ to explain the spell is still centered on caster's location.\n\n\n",html:"<h2>News</h2>\n<p>The news is that the News section is gone, replaced by these changelogs.

My initial approach to creating\nclasses had been: start with a 5th edition concept and plug in features from other classes that seem to work. Essentially,\nthis was horrible game design.\n\nEach class and subclass needs a concept. In some cases, the translation from 5th\nedition to Mass Effect was easy, and the concept was well defined. Adepts are a great example: they're glass-cannons. Each\nadpet subclass also had a unified concept. Commandos dish out huge amounts of single target damage, focusing on\nforce-type biotic powers. Blackstars were control experts. Disruptors had the most AoE potential and had benefits to\nnecrotic powers. Unfortunately, all the other classes and subclasses fell short (with a few exceptions).\n\nThe engineers were severely underpowered. This was an inherent problem with the variable (X-cost) casting mechanic.\nThe infiltrator subclasses looked like I'd taken all of the rogue subclasses, shaken them up in a bag, and randomly drawn out some features\nfrom each. One major oversight was that infiltrators lacked a true sniper rifle class, which was their primary weapon in\nthe Mass Effect games. Soldiers seemed uninspired. Vanguards had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown into their progression tables.\nAnd sentinels felt too much like a multiclasses engineer/adept.\n\nTherefore, classes have received a number of significant changes. For each class and subclass, I started with a concept and made sure the\nbase class reflected that concept. The base class concepts are rooted in how the class played in the Mass Effect games.\nThe subclasses are unique creations that focus on a particular aspect of the base class.\n\n## Adepts\nThe adepts were generally fine and should feel like they did in v0.8.4. However the number of spell slots have been\nreduced to match the spell progression of \"full-casters\" in 5th edition (clerics, druids, bards, sorcerers, wizards).\n_Note: ME5e spells are squished by 2. I.e. a 1st-level spell in ME5e is in between a 1st/2nd-level spell in 5th edition_. \nInstead of set levels in which an Adept learns new spells, they can learn new spells at every level, giving them many\nmore opportunities to advance their arsenal.\n\n## Engineers\n__Concept__: Versatile casters.\n\n__Subclass Concepts__: Drones, Healing, Strategy\n\nThe Engineer tech point system has been overhauled. Instead of tech spells having a variable cost, tech spells have spell\nlevels. Engineers use tech points to cast those spells, requiring one tech point for each level of the spell they want to cast:\n1 tp = 1st level, 2tp = 2nd level, etc. This is a very minor change to 5th editions spell slot system, but it gives the\nengineers a greater amount of versatility. Should I keep casting pot shots for 1 tech point? Or should I pump all of\nmy tech points into a spell for a huge payoff. They're still limited in how many tech points they can spend (a 50th level \nincinerate is just a bit OP...). But they have the option of casting 50 1st-level incinerates or 10 5th-level incinerates,\nwhereas traditional casters are limited by their spell slots. This makes engineers adaptable to any situation.\n\n__Drone Jockey__\nDrone Jockeys remain unchanged.\n\n__Medic__\nMedics remain unchanged.\n\n__Mastermind__\nMasterminds are always one step ahead of their enemies. Moved from the Sentinel class, masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals.\n- _enfilade_ detonate primed enemies with your reaction, setting up the perfect combo\n- _jack of all trades_ general ability in all skills\n- _extra attack_\n- _tactical advantage_ grants you bott advancement options for all your advanced spells, making any strategy possible\n- _spell steal_ is your ultimate trump card against other casters\n\n<br>\n\n## Infiltrators\n__Concept__: Stealthy combatants that fight from the shadows. The parity between Rogues and Infiltrators is self-evident, so the infiltrator base class is heavily based on rogues.\n\n__Subclass Concepts__: Melee, Sabotage, Sniper Rifles\n\nThough Infiltrators had a number of interesting combat options, Tactical Cloak proved too powerful to pass up in playtesting.\nEach round of an infiltrator's turn consisted of Attack, Tactical Cloak, Move. With tactical cloak always on,\nthe infiltrator rarely suffered damage could always apply their sneak attack damage. This made for rather boring combat.\n\nAnother issues was multiclassing an Engineer with 2 levels of Infiltrator provided more opportunities for tactical cloak\nthan a full infiltrator.\n\nTo fix these issues, Tactical Cloak uses are limited to two users per short rest, increasing based on infiltrator level.\n\n__Shadow__\nFocus on melee attacks, closing distance, and sneaking up on targets.\n- _up close and personal_ increases your sneak attack damage with melee weapons\n- _silent cloak_ allows you to close distance without being noticed.\n- _melee prowess_ improves your melee weapon attacks and damage\n- _shadow strike_ improves your tactical cloak, allowing you to close distance, escape movement impairing effects, and strike targets\n- _death strike_ grants an opportunity to deal devastating damage with a single opening attack\n\n<br>\n\n__Sniper__\nFocus on using sniper rifles, giving infiltrators a subclass that references their Mass Effect counterpart\n- _steady aim_ a powerful feature making this subclass deadly with a sniper rifle\n- _careful eyes_ find targets even when they're hidden\n- _overwatch_ monitor the battlefield and attack any creature that tries to move out of cover\n- _killshot_ improved sneak attack damage with sniper rifles.\n\n<br>\n\n__Saboteur__\nSaboteurs control the battlefield using distractions, tech powers, and sabotage. Very similar to arcane tricksters.\n- _saboteur's touch_ sabotage enemy weapons\n- _combat heuristics_ regain tech points every time you take down an enemy\n- _tactical ambush_ increase the effectiveness of your spells when you use them from tactical cloak\n- _misdirection_ make sure you're never hit in combat again\n- _saboteur's reflexes_ rule the first round of combat by taking two turns\n\n<br>\n\n## Sentinels\n__Concept__: Tanks and combat leaders\n\n__Subclass concepts__: Leadership, Survivability, Support\n\nSentinels felt too much like a multi-classed adept and engineer. The new sentinel progression attempts to provide a\nunique spellcasting experience for the class, utilizing the warlock progression from 5th edition.\n\nTech Armor was proving too powerful at high levels, granting as much as 300 additional hit points. The number of uses\nper long rest has been reduced to 2.\n\nFinally, the stat split for sentinels is over. Choosing between Wisdom and Intelligence was too much of a hindrance\nand didn't make sense with the simplified spell system. Charisma is now a sentinel's spellcasting modifier.\n\n__Bastion__\nBastions are combat leaders. Their features are based on the Warlord concept from Mike Mearls. Whereas masterminds\nfocus on increasing their own combat potential, bastions focus on increasing the potential of their party members.\n- _master tactician_ increases the range of Help action and allows it as a bonus action\n- _tactical focus_ choose an area of the battlefield and apply a unique tactic, the number of tactics and size of the area increases as you level\n- _every ready_ make sure you're never surprised again and keep yourself at the top of the initiative order\n- _call the shots_ sacrifice your action to bolster your allies and inhibit your enemies\n- _tactical maneuvers_ direct your troops around the battle field\n- _synchronized assault_ give your allies an additional action\n\n<br>\n\n__Juggernaut__\nJuggernauts are living tanks, nearly impossible to kill.\n- _assault armor_ keep the action on you\n- _hardened tech armor_ increased ac and nullify critical hits\n- _advanced tech armor_ keep your tech armor alive by gaining hit points when you cast spells\n- _unyielding assault_ avoid becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen\n- _adaptive tech armor_ gain resistance to the last type of damage you took\n\n<br>\n\n__Guardian__\nUltimate support specialists. They can buff the party but their expertise helps in non-combat situations. Overall, guardians\nremain similar to their previous iterations. The primary change is that they are no longer limited to learn specific auras,\nand their auras last 10 minutes.\n\n## Soldiers\n__Concept__: Weapon masters and combat experts.\n\n__Subclass Concepts__: Combat Prowess, Weapon focus, EXPLOSIONS!!!\n\n__Havoc Subclass__\nHavoc soldiers do just that, cause havoc. They do so by using grenades, heavy weapons, and more powerful combat powers.\n- _advanced weapon holsters_ allow havoc soldiers to bring more guns into a fight\n- _makeshift grenades_ never run out of grenades again, use your omni-gel to create new ones\n- _advanced combat powers_ do more with your combat powers\n- _heavy weapon hack_ never run out of heavy weapon charges, use your omni-gel to create new ones\n- _paint by number_ target and fire your heavy weapons in the same round.\n\n<br>\n\n__Weapon Master__\nWeapon masters specialize in a single weapon. Mostly unchanged from the previous version, except their superiority die-type\nincreases with their level.\n\n__Gladiator__\nBased on the Samurai of 5th Edition's Unearthed Arcana. Gladiators revel in te challenge of combat and are extremely\ndifficult to kill. Their fighting spirit gives them incredible advantage in combat and can even prevent death.\n\n\n## Vanguards\n__Concept__: war-casters that use high-risk, high-reward tactics\n\n__Subclass Concepts__: Melee, Shotguns & Charge, Biotic Powers\n\nVanguards spellcasting has been adjusted to \"half-caster\" level (paladins & rangers), requiring more emphasis on barrier\nmanipulation and close-quarter combat. However the nemesis subclass was reworked to provide a ranged option for vanguards\nwith unique biotic talents.\n\nVanguards can also learn combat powers instead of learning new cantrips.\n\n__Battle Master__\nBattle masters use their barrier ticks to create unique opportunities in combat. New features have been introduced that\nincrease their melee combat potential.\n- _biotic maneuvers_ unique talents that can be applied using barrier ticks\n- _biotic focus_ greatly increase your melee combat potential\n- _improved barrier_ increase the potency of your barrier\n- _extra attack_ gain an additional attack with this subclass,\n- _opportunist_ use your reaction to strike creatures that have been hit with other attacks\n\n<br>\n\n__Shock Trooper__\nShock troopers are built around the charge cantrip, jumping from enemy to enemy, and closing distance for shotgun blasts.\n- _biotic bull rush_ improves the charge cantrip and grants an additional weapoin attack\n- _stunning strike_ further improves the charge cantrip by adding a potential stun\n- _shotgun savvy_ allows you to apply brutal critical and zero-sum to your shotgun attacks\n- _onslaught_ greatly improves the damage of charge\n- _a touch of force_ adds a bonus to weapon attacks\n- _blitz_ lets you use charge as a reaction\n\n<br>\n\n__Nemesis__\nNemesis vanguards focus on biotic powers and range. While they lack the biotic potential of adepts, they make up for it with survivability.\n- _biotic recovery_ regenerates spell slots\n- _metabiotics_ grants powerful augmentations to your biotic spells\n- _biotic attacks_ take advantage of your extra attack by reducing the casting time of specific spells to an attack\n- _biotic fury_ apply the benefits of zero-sum and brutal critical to your biotic spells\n- _teleporting dodge_ stay out of harms way\n- _bombardment_ deal even more damage with your biotic spells\n\n<br>\n\n## Races\n\n### Quarians\n- Use omni-gel to patch their suit.\n\n### Geth\n- Armor rules improved\n- Soldier's hunter mode improved.\n- removed keen senses\n\n### Salarian\n- clarified that salarians gain a short rest in 4 hours\n\n### Turian\n- added additional weapon proficiency\n\n### Unshackled AI\n- Armor rules improved\n- removed keen senses\n\n### New Race Concepts\nWhile not official races, you can check out the Hanar and Elcor concepts in the new [Found Codices section](/phb/appendix/found-codices).\n\n## Spells\n\n- __ai hacking__ adjusted text to resemble dominate\n  - _power down_ replaces damaging advancement, allows you to incapacitate the target\n- __ballistic blades__\n  - _exploding blades_ thunder damage reduced\n- __barrier detonation__ added length, changed to Strength saving throw, targets with shields have advantage on the saving throw, clarified advancements\n- __behive__ damage increased by 1d6\n  - _remote deploy_ allows firing beehive as a reaction as well\n- __concussive shot__ damage increases with level.\n  - _stunning shot_ con save happens instead of str save\n- __charge__: Is a ranged spell attack with a single target.\n  - _Stunning blow_ removed (too powerful for a cantrip), replaced with _Area Charge_ for AoE potential.\n- __cryo beam__ updated as a 2nd level spell, increased damage, allows continual casting\n- __cryo blast__ updated as a 1st level spell, aoe slow spell that better represents its in-game counterpart, increased range\n- __decoy__ adjusted to reflect 5th edition's mirror image\n- __defense matrix__ adjusted to reflect 5th edition's shield of faith\n- __disrupt biotics__ adjusted to reflect 5th edition's counterspell\n  - _psychic strain_ deals more damage\n- __electric slash__ updated as 2nd level spell\n- __energy drain__ updated as 1st level spell, increased range\n- __first aid__ updated as 1st level spell\n- __flamethrower__ updated as 3rd level spell\n- __fortification__\n  - _venting fortification_ works on next melee attack, does not require omni-tool\n- __guidance__ changed to bonus action, increased range\n- __havoc strike__ increased usage to twice per long rest\n- __hawk missile launcher__ casting time increased to bonus action\n  - _three-headed beast_ replaces _improved damage_.

My initial approach to creating\nclasses had been: start with a 5th edition concept and plug in features from other classes that seem to work. Essentially,\nthis was horrible game design.</p>\n<p>Each class and subclass needs a concept. In some cases, the translation from 5th\nedition to Mass Effect was easy, and the concept was well defined. Adepts are a great example: they're glass-cannons. Each\nadpet subclass also had a unified concept. Commandos dish out huge amounts of single target damage, focusing on\nforce-type biotic powers. Blackstars were control experts. Disruptors had the most AoE potential and had benefits to\nnecrotic powers. Unfortunately, all the other classes and subclasses fell short (with a few exceptions).</p>\n<p>The engineers were severely underpowered. This was an inherent problem with the variable (X-cost) casting mechanic.\nThe infiltrator subclasses looked like I'd taken all of the rogue subclasses, shaken them up in a bag, and randomly drawn out some features\nfrom each. One major oversight was that infiltrators lacked a true sniper rifle class, which was their primary weapon in\nthe Mass Effect games. Soldiers seemed uninspired. Vanguards had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown into their progression tables.\nAnd sentinels felt too much like a multiclasses engineer/adept.</p>\n<p>Therefore, classes have received a number of significant changes. For each class and subclass, I started with a concept and made sure the\nbase class reflected that concept. The base class concepts are rooted in how the class played in the Mass Effect games.\nThe subclasses are unique creations that focus on a particular aspect of the base class.</p>\n<h2>Adepts</h2>\n<p>The adepts were generally fine and should feel like they did in v0.8.4. However the number of spell slots have been\nreduced to match the spell progression of &quot;full-casters&quot; in 5th edition (clerics, druids, bards, sorcerers, wizards).\n<em>Note: ME5e spells are squished by 2. I.e. a 1st-level spell in ME5e is in between a 1st/2nd-level spell in 5th edition</em>.\nInstead of set levels in which an Adept learns new spells, they can learn new spells at every level, giving them many\nmore opportunities to advance their arsenal.</p>\n<h2>Engineers</h2>\n<p><strong>Concept</strong>: Versatile casters.</p>\n<p><strong>Subclass Concepts</strong>: Drones, Healing, Strategy</p>\n<p>The Engineer tech point system has been overhauled. Instead of tech spells having a variable cost, tech spells have spell\nlevels. Engineers use tech points to cast those spells, requiring one tech point for each level of the spell they want to cast:\n1 tp = 1st level, 2tp = 2nd level, etc. This is a very minor change to 5th editions spell slot system, but it gives the\nengineers a greater amount of versatility. Should I keep casting pot shots for 1 tech point? Or should I pump all of\nmy tech points into a spell for a huge payoff. They're still limited in how many tech points they can spend (a 50th level\nincinerate is just a bit OP...). But they have the option of casting 50 1st-level incinerates or 10 5th-level incinerates,\nwhereas traditional casters are limited by their spell slots. This makes engineers adaptable to any situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Drone Jockey</strong>\nDrone Jockeys remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Medic</strong>\nMedics remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastermind</strong>\nMasterminds are always one step ahead of their enemies. Moved from the Sentinel class, masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>enfilade</em> detonate primed enemies with your reaction, setting up the perfect combo</li>\n<li><em>jack of all trades</em> general ability in all skills</li>\n<li><em>extra attack</em></li>\n<li><em>tactical advantage</em> grants you bott advancement options for all your advanced spells, making any strategy possible</li>\n<li><em>spell steal</em> is your ultimate trump card against other casters</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2>Infiltrators</h2>\n<p><strong>Concept</strong>: Stealthy combatants that fight from the shadows. The parity between Rogues and Infiltrators is self-evident, so the infiltrator base class is heavily based on rogues.</p>\n<p><strong>Subclass Concepts</strong>: Melee, Sabotage, Sniper Rifles</p>\n<p>Though Infiltrators had a number of interesting combat options, Tactical Cloak proved too powerful to pass up in playtesting.\nEach round of an infiltrator's turn consisted of Attack, Tactical Cloak, Move. With tactical cloak always on,\nthe infiltrator rarely suffered damage could always apply their sneak attack damage. This made for rather boring combat.</p>\n<p>Another issues was multiclassing an Engineer with 2 levels of Infiltrator provided more opportunities for tactical cloak\nthan a full infiltrator.</p>\n<p>To fix these issues, Tactical Cloak uses are limited to two users per short rest, increasing based on infiltrator level.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadow</strong>\nFocus on melee attacks, closing distance, and sneaking up on targets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>up close and personal</em> increases your sneak attack damage with melee weapons</li>\n<li><em>silent cloak</em> allows you to close distance without being noticed.</li>\n<li><em>melee prowess</em> improves your melee weapon attacks and damage</li>\n<li><em>shadow strike</em> improves your tactical cloak, allowing you to close distance, escape movement impairing effects, and strike targets</li>\n<li><em>death strike</em> grants an opportunity to deal devastating damage with a single opening attack</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Sniper</strong>\nFocus on using sniper rifles, giving infiltrators a subclass that references their Mass Effect counterpart</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>steady aim</em> a powerful feature making this subclass deadly with a sniper rifle</li>\n<li><em>careful eyes</em> find targets even when they're hidden</li>\n<li><em>overwatch</em> monitor the battlefield and attack any creature that tries to move out of cover</li>\n<li><em>killshot</em> improved sneak attack damage with sniper rifles.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Saboteur</strong>\nSaboteurs control the battlefield using distractions, tech powers, and sabotage.

Many felt this change was either\nconfusing or didn't fit the Mass Effect lore.\n\nThese types of nuances can be difficult, specifically which abilities apply to which classes.

Admittedly, this change was an attempt \nto bring some balance to the spellcasting skills; an attempt to equalize the use of CHA, WIS, and INT in spellcasting modifiers.\nBut the flavor text to support this change wasn't enough.\n\nThus, I've changed the Sentinel's spellcasting mod to be player/GM choice. Although this technique might be unheard of,\nI feel it allows each group of players to decide which spellcasting ability makes the most sense to the group:\n\nINT: The sentinel uses a high IQ to multi-task in combat and find strategic locations to place spells\nCHA: The sentinel uses willpower to overcome the mental strain and innate talents or brute force when casting spells\nWIS: The sentinel uses intense focus and practiced patience or combat insight when using spells\n\nAs a GM, work with your sentinel operatives to decide what you'd like to use for your campaign, or, based on the operative's\nbackstory and roleplay, let them choose!\n\n### Vanguard\n__Shocktrooper__\n- _Biotic bull rush_. Bonus distance increased to 20m to compensate for charge's increased distance.\n\n## Spells\n- __Charge__ I can honestly say that the Charge spell has changed more times than any other spell (and we're probably not finished). \n  We've playtested it as spell attack, and the damage was lacking. Moreover, a miss resulted in no movement (which is supposed \n  to be a benefit of the power). The current iteration makes Charge a DEX save power, always providing movement and dealing\n  some minor damage if the creature fails its saving throw. There is no half damage on a successful save (keeping in line\n  with 5th edition cantrips). Additionally, the range and damage have been increased to 14m and 1d10, respectively.\n  - _Barrier Regen_ To compensate for changes to Charge, the barrier regen has been reduced to 2 ticks instead of half\n      of your ticks. When casting Charge, you will always gain barrier ticks, which is why the number was reduced.\n      Although this breaks tradition with the Mass Effect advancements, this is one of those times where the video game\n      mechanic doesn't mesh well with the D&D combat system.\n  - _Area Charge_. Increase the radius to 4m.\n- __Hawk Missile Launcher__\n  - _Three-headed beast_. Clarified that the damage is split between the three missiles.\n\n## Bestiary\n\n- Oculus\n- STG Agent\n- Sniper\n- Blue Suns faction\n  - Centurion\n  - Heavy\n  - Legate\n  - Legionnaire\n  - Pyro\n  - Trooper\n- Blood Pack\n  - Boom-Squad\n  - Pyro\n  - Trooper\n  - Warlord\n  - Warrior\n\n\n### Other\n\n- Optional rules for Indoctrination can be found in the Found Codices section of the Appendix\n",html:"<br>\n<h1>v0.9.1</h1>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with software development, any sub-1.0 version is generally considered &quot;in beta&quot;, which basically means\nan incomplete product. v0.9.0 brings us to the cusp of moving beyond beta and into a true production release.
