You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you 
make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra meters, instead of the normal 2 extra meters.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue 
to act independently, not as a controlled mount.
