You can use an Action to secretes a noxious poison in a 4m-radious sphere centered on its location. Each creature within the sphere
must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage. If the poison damage 
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1 hour.
