As an action, choose up to 5 friendly creatures with shields you can see. Hack into their armor system and use a brute 
force algorithm to overload their kinetic barrier. Roll 4d8. Each creature immediately gains that many shield points, 
even if their total shield point capacity is less than the amount rolled.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
